Pos, the ultimate match up between good and evil     the untouchables   is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry    based on the 1959 television show of the same title     the untouchables   may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place   but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences   some excellent acting   a memorable score   and a clever script    the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public    elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order    however   as ness soon learns   in order to stabilize peace   you have to bend a few laws    the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes    the film begins with capone   played perfectly by deniro   declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws    the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone s men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl    from this point we know capone is evil   not only because he kills without hesitation   but also because he is a lying bastard    right from the first five minutes of the film   de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs    this developed hatred is before the film s hero   ness   is even introduced    i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone    the film only gets better from this point    with the formation of the untouchables   there is a group of men wearing long   dark overcoats and hats    they walk in unison and they only look forward    as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens    holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals   this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films    one that comes to mind is   the matrix   when neo   morpheus   trinity   and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world    wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930 s style   the similarities between these two are countless       the untouchables   has some of the hippest   bravest heroes in any action film    the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone s army    each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others    elliot ness   played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner   is a character that surely grows during the course of the film    he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be    however   as the film develops so does ness    his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side    he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends    his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in    sean connery   who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role   plays malone   an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables    malone acts as a mentor to ness    he teaches him   the chicago way   to do things   when they attack with a knife   you attack with a gun    connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed    andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone   a young man who is just becoming a police officer    as ness grows   he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him    charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone    smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film    the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen    also very similar to   the matrix     they are exciting and intense    >from a western like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps   the scenes are well thought out and well executed    the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement    its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors    the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective    although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified   this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting   great directing   and great action    some scenes   capone and the baseball bat   the train station   have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid    

Pos, one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction    the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy   innocent fun    sometimes the stories are compelling    sometimes they re not    but   with the exception of the first film in the series   which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces     i ve never been bored by any of the enterprise s numerous missions    star trek   insurrection is no exception    the film has gotten some negative reviews   a friend of mine actually thinks it s the worst in the series     but i m not really sure why    it s an exciting   often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film    some say it s a bit too light   and more of a long episode than a film    others say the special effects are cheesy and that it s boring    i simply enjoyed the film    insurrection   which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast   introduces us to a race of people called the ba ku   the ba ku are very old   most of them are about three hundred years old     but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet    of course   these peaceful people can t horde this fountain of youth all for themselves   leave it up to their archenemies   the son a   led by ru afo   f    murray abraham     to mess everything up    the son a   who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable   strike a deal with the federation to move the ba ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying    that s when captain picard   patrick stewart   steps in   he realizes that moving the ba ku would kill them   it also helps that he falls in love with a ba ku woman   donna murphy        so   with his trusty crew   picard defies the federation to keep the ba ku in their natural habitat    when dealing with a series with as much history as this   it s not entirely necessary to re introduce your characters with each episode    this is why i believe non fans have a hard time getting into star trek   in order to enjoy it   one has to understand how to approach it    insurrection   however   does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters    stewart is bold as always   a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together    jonathan frakes   who also directed   is funny as commander riker   a subplot with data   brent spiner   discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting   and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain   overacting like crazy    frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact   insurrection is an exciting film   with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action    this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation   and the result is very pleasing to the eye   particularly in the climactic scenes   in which the son a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba ku planet   the special effects have a clean   impressively sharp look    if i have any complaint about the film   it s that it tries to take a moral stance when it s not very appropriate to do so    i don t think it s that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba ku in order to save the lives of thousands    better yet   why couldn t they have co existed    insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience    with it s inherent camp factor   the star trek series doesn t seem well equipped to deal with issues like this    i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle    

Pos, for those of us who weren t yet born when the 1960 s rock  n  rolled around   monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies    from otis redding to jimi hendrix   janis joplin to the mamas and the papas   and jefferson airplane to the who   this documentary is jam packed with contagious energy    but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending   which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves    shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock   the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time    sure   some have painted their faces and smoke joints   but d   a    pennebaker   the war room   moon over broadway   surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience    no matter who is watching   it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul    the excitement starts before the music even begins    a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer   she replies that she feels lucky to do so    there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips   leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers   tries to get in touch with dionne warwick    and when one band is tuning up   a member remarks     finally   a decent sound system !    you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn t about vanity   it s about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it   a two way street    this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience    it s impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain    and while the lyrics to   wild thing   may not be all that complicated   watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love    even if you don t recognize every band you see on stage   you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats    the only drawback to the film is the ending   which unfortunately i must reveal    all the other bands   big names then and still today   got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time    in contrast   the last band on camera   a wholly forgettable one   gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time    for a film that s only 78 minutes long   that s too large of a chunk   especially when previous acts are much more stimulating    all in all   monterey pop is a precious   rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us    the variety of music   as well as the beautifully shot performances   are easy to become immersed in    if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular   this is quickly dispelled    it s almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn t get made much anymore    instead we re stuck with * nsync   the backstreet boys   and jennifer lopez   all of whom should have stuck with modeling    

Pos, that thing you do !     r   tom hanks s screenwriting and directorial debut   that thing you do !   has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment   fun   lively   and oh so nice    it is the latter quality   however   that becomes a hindrance   for this  60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast    that thing focuses on the wonders   a teen rock band from erie   pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called   of course     that thing you do !    the group s members are   naturally a diverse group   there s brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy   johnathon schaech     girl crazy lenny   steve zahn     the lead guitarist   a goofy   geeky type known only as the bass player   ethan embry     and the film s center   guy   tom everett scott     the drummer who has aspirations in jazz    along for the wonders  ride to success is jimmy s perpetually neglected galpal   faye   liv tyler      hanks proves to be a capable writer director   deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964   which hanks calls   the last innocent year      the spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music   which   like the other recent period music film   grace of my heart   was expressly written for the film   hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes  but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger   which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled   it s still playing in my mind as i write this      it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors   eliciting charming   likable work from the entire cast   most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler   who is remarkable in delivering the film s biggest and best dramatic moment    the work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early  60s   they do not appear to be  90s grungers playacting   retro      yet for all the light   frothy charms of that thing you do !   it s nearly nice to a fault    while this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days   there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting    everyone is so happy   basking in the glow of overnight success   marvelling at it all  except toward the end   but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness   ending on an appropriately feel good note    there isn t much of an edge throughout that thing  the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks s turn as the wonders  manager  and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it s bland    but a little niceness goes a long way these days   and there s no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do !   it s just about impossible to hate    it s an inoffensive   enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming   if not singing     that thing you do !     quite  possibly for days    to paraphrase a passage from the song   though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play   that thing you do !    

Pos, what do you get when you slap together a movie based on a story by the legendary george lucas   directed by virtuoso director steven spielberg   and starring one of the biggest box office stars in the world   harrison ford    you get one hot fudge rockin  good time   that s what you get ! ! !  plot   professor/archeologist indiana jones sets out to find the long lost mystical ark of the covenant before the nazis get their grubby fingers hands on it    adventures   snakes   romance and mucho action ensues    critique   astounding movie packed with non stop action   stunts galore   an interesting story line   great one liners   a solid cast   a catchy musical score   and all the fun and adventure that you could squeeze into a two hour thrill ride    if you don t enjoy this film   then you just don t like action movies   period !  if you re young   you ll enjoy its humor   its cool action sequences and its gross out factor at times    if you re a little older   you ll appreciate the interesting plot line   the romance   and yes   the mountains of adventure    watching this movie made me feel like a kid again   dreaming and fantasizing about fighting the bad guys   travelling to different countries   making the impossible   possible !  harrison ford is perfect as the every man with the brains of a scientist and the brawn of an outdoors adventurer   and spielberg manages to achieve the ideal balance of action   fun   adventure and humor    now if you really want to have a good time   check into this movie on the same night as its two sequels   rent a jug of iced coke   truckloads of nachos and salsa   an adventure hat and whip   and prepare to gag yourself into a world of action movie heaven !  little known facts about this film and its stars   this picture was nominated for eight 1981 oscar nominations   including best picture    it lost that award to chariots of fire   but did manage to win for best art direction   best special effects   best film editing and best sound    actor tom selleck was originally cast as indiana jones   but was committed to his hit tv show     magnum p   i        in filming the well of souls sequence   the producers scoured every pet shop in london and the south of england for every snake they could lay their hands on    hence there are snakes that are identifiable from many different geographical areas    however   once all the snakes were on set   it became clear that there were not nearly enough of them   so spielberg had several hoses cut into lengths   and these were used as well    looking closely   you can tell which are the real snakes and which are not    an early draft of the script had indy travelling to shanghai to recover a piece of the staff of ra    during his escape from the museum where it was housed   he sheltered from machine gun fire behind a giant rolling gong    also in the same script   indy and marion flee the chaos caused by the opening of the ark in a wild mine cart chase sequence    both of these scenes were cut from the script   but ended up in 1984 s indiana jones and the temple of doom    this film begins with a shot of a peak in the jungle which is reminiscent of the paramount pictures logo    the same type of opening is present in its sequels    jock s airplane at the beginning of the film has the registration number   ob cpo      this is a reference to obi wan and c 3po from george lucas  star wars   9   5/10      also   the hieroglyphics in the well of souls include engravings of r2 d2 and c 3po    they can be seen on a post to the right of indy and sallah as they remove the ark    the script originally included a long fight between a swordsman and indiana with his whip    as legend has it   actor harrison ford was suffering diarrhea at the time   and asked if the scene could be shortened    spielberg said the only way he could shorten it was if indy pulled out his gun and just shot the guy    the entire crew laughed and that s how it was filmed    when indy first falls in the well of souls and is face to face with the cobra   you can see the snake s reflection on the glass dividing it and harrison ford   also some fingerprints and stuff like that    when indy is dragging along the ground   hanging onto the nazi soldier s truck with the ark inside   you can see the pad that he s being dragged on    

Pos, i had been expecting more of this movie than the less than thrilling twister    twister was good but had no real plot and no one to simpithize with    but twister had amazing effects and i was hoping so would volcano  volcano starts with tommy lee jones at emo    he worrys about a small earthquake enough to leave his daughter at home with a baby sitter    there is one small quake then another quake    then a geologist points out to tommy that its takes a geologic event to heat millions of gallons of water in 12 hours    a few hours later large amount of ash start to fall    then         it  starts    the volcanic eruption          i liked this movie       but  it was not as great as i hoped    i was still good none the less    it had excellent special effects    the best view       the  helecopters flying over the streets of volcanos    also       there were interesting side stories that made the plot more interesting    so       it was good ! !  

Pos, there s an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last    george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy    return of the jedi   the final installment of the series   is easily the most innovative   action packed   and entertaining of the three films    the dark   eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone    instead   for return of the jedi   we have good triumphing decisively over evil   a resolution to a love triangle   and walking teddy bears    even darth vader doesn t seem very intimidating this time around    with the arrival of the emperor   an apparition like creature played by ian mcdiarmid     vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman    return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back    luke skywalker   mark hamill     princess leia   carrie fisher     lando calrissian     billy dee williams     chewbacca   peter mayhew     c3p0   anthony daniels   and r2 d2   kenny baker   are on a rescue mission to luke s home planet of tatooine    their goal   to save han solo   harrison ford   from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt    it is at jabba s home   a creepy looking stone fortress guarded by hog nosed beasts   that most of the added special effects come into play    from a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba s sand barge   the effects are top notch    as soon as han is freed from his cryo freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt   it s back to outer space   where the rebel alliance is about to face the empire s newest threat   a second   more powerful death star   that   if activated   could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor    so   while the fleet prepares for the final battle   luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks    there   they are befriended by the ewoks   the teddy bear like native race   and luke   fearing that his presence is endangering the group   turns himself over to vader    return of the jedi has some interesting elements    the scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well acted    from a technical point of view   the space battles are amazing   easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films    not only are there many   many more ships   but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved    on one level   return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects    in the special edition   even more ships are added   making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch    the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films    by now   or then   1983     mark hamill   harrison ford   and carrie fisher have all matured in their on screen personas    the chemistry amongst the trio is terrific    as in empire   billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for    newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy   cunning   and evil creature   although he s not as imposing as vader was in star wars    although it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen   return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment    with the spectacular   new special effects   the adorable ewoks   the sinister jabba the hutt   the evil emperor   the same old millenium falcon   darth vader s incredible betrayal   the destruction of the new death star   and the always lovable yoda   return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang    congratulations to george lucas   whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come        

Pos, roman emperor marcus aurelius   richard harris   chooses his trusted general maximus   russell crowe   as his successor    however the emperor s evil son commodus   joaquin phoenix   murders his father before the announcement can be made   and maximus   as well as his family   is sentenced to be executed    maximus is able to escape his executioners   but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo   oliver reed      proximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money   he being a former gladiator himself     and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator    when emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum   proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle    maximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus    gladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania   and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required   40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence   style of moviemaking    the only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used        it s choppy slow motion which is unsettling and distracting    it s similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan   but nowhere near as effective    the actual gladiator battles are thrilling   but also a bit disjointed    many times it s unclear as to exactly what s going on        all the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled    we re not sure who s blood or by who s hand though    there s an instance of this earlier in the film too that s disappointing    it s comes when maximus escapes his executioners    some flashes and a few quick cuts later and maximus is free        but i still don t know exactly how he did it    russell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995 s virtuosity    for whatever reason his stardom never arrived        but he should have it now    from here on moviegoers should now be able to say     let s go see the new russell crowe movie      he gets the best scene in the film   and one of the best moments of all recent movies   when he reveals his identity to commodus in the colisseum    it s both rousing and chilling    joaquin phoenix does a very effective job of making commodus a person and not just a cartoon character   which could have easily happened      commodus is conniving   sneaky and whiny   but phoenix never lets the character get silly    it s a very good   and very creepy   performance    oliver reed died during the filming of gladiator   and it s a huge loss to the acting world    i ve always been fascinated with reed        he s one of those very talented performers who once had a fine career but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight years    it s ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again   as he gives a fun and sincere performance    the film is dedicated to him   and he will surely be missed    reed s death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem   as he still had scenes to be completed    rather than recast the role   and end up reshooting a great deal of footage     a digital version of oliver reed was created at a reported cost of 2 million dollars    ironically   that was probably more money than reed ever earned for a single film    anyway   this digital effect is only used in one scene that i am aware of   for about twenty seconds   and if you aren t looking for it you won t even be able to tell    some of the other digital effects are less convincing however        and like i always say   noticable digital effects take me out of a movie immediately    it s sad that such a good film has these distractions    movies like the fall of the roman empire and spartacus seemed to do okay without the use of computer effects    keep in mind that gladiator is based on real people and real events   but is entirely a work of fiction    however it s a work of fiction that s great entertainment   and another film to add to the list of damn fine flicks released in 2000 a   d    

Pos, since 1990   the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style    now   instead of emphasizing feel good stories replete with characters of noble virtues   the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow    this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times   as 1993 s schindler s list shows    most of today s mainstream drama   however   creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience    that s why pictures like october sky   which are a throwback to the good ol  dramas of yesteryear   are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema    the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam   jake gyllenhaal     a teenager in the 1950 s company town of coalwood   west virginia    it s a well known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships   the rest grow up to work in the coal mine    the mine   which is run by homer s father   chris cooper     is not the place for homer   however    after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957   homer feels a connection with the outside world    as he puts it     anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did      drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast   homer begins to construct rockets    with the help of their history teacher   miss riley   laura dern     and several mine workers   the four are soon bound for great things    october sky is a skillfully crafted film   and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston    johnston    whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars    certainly knows what he s doing here    he molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust    he does not push any barriers   but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film s charm    his finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost    such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers   or the silent struggle between homer s mother and father    the cast is well chosen   although the true bright spots are the supporting roles    laura dern   jurassic park   lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher   giving the boys the support and guidance they need    her role is instantly likeable    chris cooper   the horse whisperer     as homer s father   is less likeable    even downright despicable at times    but his turn here gives gravity to the movie    he s definitely a driving force in homer s life   and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable    the script is generally cheerful   projecting the boys  endeavors in a lighthearted manner    there are moments when it becomes predictable    such as the train tracks scene    and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist    it highlights the essence of youth   however   and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps    october sky should be a success with audiences    although it doesn t have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she s all that   it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards    it s a welcome change to the dramatic genre   and one that everyone should see    

Pos, james l   brooks   one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news   returns to the big screen with this entertaining   if slightly flawed comedy    nicholson plays melvin udall   probably the most horrible person ever on the screen    he s racist   homophobic   and never has a good word to say to anyone    so   nobody talks to him   except waitress carol conelly   t   v  sitcom star hunt   who was last seen in twister   1996      naturally   udall   conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop   kinnear   who nicholson hates   all hit it off in the end    like good will hunting   1997   and titanic   1997     even though the outcome is completely obvious   as good as it gets is an enjoyable   funny and warm comedy    nicholson is hilarious as melvin   churning out insults with superb relish    only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers    hunt is also good as waitress carol   and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson    there s also   thankfully   a bit of chemistry between them    kinnear   as the gay neighbor   seems to have a slightly underwritten role   he s more of a plot convience than a character    although his performance is good   his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together    in fact   the scene stealer is simon s dog   who is funnier than nicholson    but then again   pets are always cute on screen    providing solid support is cuba gooding   jnr   jerry maguire   1996   and yeardly smith   who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons   although gooding isn t as good as is character in maguire   he is still fun    he overacts a little   but not so much as to be annoying    smith is also good   although she has a fairly small role    even director lawrence kasdan   body heat   1981   makes an appearance as a doctor    but this is primarily nicholsons film   and every scene he s in   he s steals it    he s character is so hateful   though   it s amazing that anyone talks to him at all   especially carol    and this is the films main problem    it s totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin    she doesn t fall in love with him naturally   the film forces her to fall in love with him    also   melvins character seems to go too nice   too quickly    i would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice   loving person    it would take a helluva long time   much longer than this film would like to make out    brooks direction is good   though   if a bit average   but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience    he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones   he tends to pile on to much schmaltz   but generally he s good    there s also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer    but   generally   as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do   which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie    the movie is a bit overlong   but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly    overall   as good as it gets is a fun movie   even though it may be unbelivable   and certainly worth seeing   if just for jack nicholsons performance      not quite as good as it gets   pardon the bad joke     but still good fun    

Pos, on re watching italian writer/director dario argento s much lauded murder mystery tenebrae   i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with    in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles   but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his   giallo   murder mysteries    while it s certainly not perfect   repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller    the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal   anthony franciosa   where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book   tenebrae      with the police on his back for leads   he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems    the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa    he brings grace   charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real life horror around him    the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension    argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral   ambivalent   shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business    tenebrae is perhaps the most multi layered of argento s scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here    it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play    in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso   the full length italian language version   and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes    needless to say for argento fans   there is no denying the director s brilliance as a stylist    many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork    they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light   rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria    instead   tenebrae s set design and lighting paints a sleek   clinical   chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world    and the soundtrack s mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment    so tenebrae has much to recommend it   no question    still   constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative    some critics argue that logic doesn t matter in argento films   but damnit   it matters in all films to the point where viewers don t deserve to feel cheated    by the way   if you don t want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs    about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which   properly handled   could have proved ingenious    we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who   we later discover   is none other than the author peter neal    he is insane   apparently    the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it s time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife    he is finally revealed to us as this   second killer   in the film s bloody climax    but argento muffs the twist   both technically and narratively    you see   we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer s house    but thanks to poor editing   its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway    bad cutting puts the timing way out    in other words   he s almost in two places at once    during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring    by the film s end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant    the injury    he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock !  thus   the revelation of the   hero   as a killer   and anti hero   in the final scenes may still prove shocking   but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled    helpfully   in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along    but there too is a problem   as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least    the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa s mind   his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage    tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies    for instance   a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike    we would assume the rider is the same boy   but it turns out to be some male character we aren t even introduced too !  that s careless filmmaking   pure and simple    why   you may ask   do i go on about the story s flaws    because when it comes to visuals and set pieces   argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world    take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae    an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where   almost unbelievably   it jumps a high fence and chases her across town    finally   as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine   she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer s lair    it s an absolutely masterful sequence   tense and exciting   and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone    and that s exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating    too often   it seems   argento s films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts    mind you   if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look    and if you re a fan of argento s unique style of giallo thriller then it s essential    see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli    it s a stylish   great looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative    a shame   because it doesn t have to be that way    take argento s more recent stendhal syndrome   1992     where with the aid of co writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache    proof that he can do it   if he tries        

Pos, it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child   whether that may be in life or in death    after having said that   i will also say that this movie does all of the above very well    one gets that choking sensation in the throat   because of grief   when one brother forgives another for a costly mistake   or when a husband hugs his wife after a long estrangement    there is no ocean   no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of yet another   ordinary people     in fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing   not that this literally happened in the movie      so what are the lessons learnt   1    don t take your children to class reunions    2   don t leave them alone in the lobby   not even for a second    michelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highly strung wife and mother   a trend that started with   a thousand acres  and   one fine day     my comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie   so much so that when she has a nervous break down   the veins on her temples bulge impressively    whoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance   playing a lesbian cop   with a name that makes one want to reach for a lollipop    lastly   who are the ideal companions for this sort of movie   my grandmother comes to mind    

Pos, just look back two years ago at the coen brothers  comedic gem the big lebowski   change the actors   take away the bowling alley   add a record store   and you ve got high fidelity   or maybe the other way around since nick hornby s novel high fidelity came first      either way   it s been done before   a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances   yet it remains consistently funny    why is this    maybe because you know your life is much better than this   you know these guys are more pathetic than you are   and you know its ok to laugh at them because they re fictional    director stephen frears   possibly not intentionally   has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day    when watching high fidelity   expect to laugh at someone else s pain   realize what you are laughing at   and then laugh again    i laughed at dick   todd louiso     the shy   timorous   steve buscemi character of lebowski   who seems to know what he is talking about but either can t put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends    i laughed at the john goodman character barry   jack black     an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons   pudgy   egotistic   and obnoxious at the same time    and i laughed at rob   john cusack     the jeff bridges type   whom the story revolves around    rob is the character easiest to relate to   but he is nothing like you at all    he uncontrollably cheats and lies   then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman    and like his other miserable friends   pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort    he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it    whatever human emotions the clash   aretha franklin   and bruce springsteen records hold   rob and co    grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives    rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in    during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on   rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him    but these aren t any girlfriends   these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob   rob s incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life      the plot in three words is   women and music    the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective    it gives high fidelity a quickly paced   informal structure   adjectives which perfectly parallel rob s own lifestyle    it also helps open the viewer s eyes as to how annoying barry is    jack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball    just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob   who must work with him every day of the week    what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes    john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast   consisting of big stars and character actors   that really defines rob    now instead of rob just talking to the camera   after he explains something   the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say    the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn t end when it should have ended    instead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that    also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie    high fidelity is a cheerful   old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs    i just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen   they make everyone look and feel great    

Pos, plot   a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes    he is taken prisoner along with some other humans   and tries his best to escape his simian captors    oh yeah   and did i mention that the apes can talk    kewl !  critique   despite this film not looking like a   tim burton movie   or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself   i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun   summer fare    although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make up jobs and characterizations    i mean   i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real !  i also have to   give it up   to all of the actors inside the costumes   not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get make up slobbered all over them for 2 4 hours   but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well    i especially enjoyed bonham carter s performance   who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film   human or ape   and tim roth s bad guy   who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part    plot wise   i liked the beginning of the film   the whole build up once wahlberg got into the village   the escape and most of the fight scenes   but once things got out into the deserted area   and the final battle sequence     i kinda lost a bit of my interest    i was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of   human beings as animals   then i was about the end battle sequence   which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film    i also hated the   kid   character who just got on my nerves and didn t really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved   i won t ruin it here but c mon guys       you  coulda thought of something a little more plausible than that   no        but the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character   his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his inter species love interests    this dude didn t seem to give a rat s ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didn t really care about what happened to him either    now i m not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script   but the film suffered because of it    visually   the movie was also nice to look at   especially the apes !     but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton    the   surprise ending   that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in 1968   felt a little tacked on here   and despite being interesting   didn t really make all that much sense to me   unless you look at it from a sequel point of view      so overall   i loved the whole   feel   of the planet   the apes that ruled it   the manner in which they treated the humans   screamed   shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain   but didn t appreciate the film s lack of human character development   why was kris kristofferson even in this movie     and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring    but i would still recommend this film as a fun   summer movie with laughs   creepiness and a really cool premise    ps   for anyone who has seen the original   i cannot believe that they didn t at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character   in this case   mark wahlberg   goes nuts at the world in which he s suddenly been thrust     this is a mad house !      type of thing      the guy in this film barely seems to be   put off   by the fact that he s surrounded by apes who can speak english ! !  where s joblo coming from    the arrival   8/10     battlefield earth   7/10     godzilla   4/10     instinct   6/10     mission to mars   3/10     pitch black   7/10       1968   planet of the apes   9/10     sleepy hollow   8/10    

Pos, known as the most successful   highest grossing romantic comedy in history   director garry marshall apparently struck gold with   pretty woman     which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but   thanks to positive word of mouth   was able to reach upwards of $175 million in theaters alone    the question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film s two charismatic stars   richard gere and julia roberts   since the story itself is none too original or even believable    the other winning element that makes   pretty woman   so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence   which is rarely as palpable in today s films as it is here    edward lewis   richard gere   is a suave   extremely wealthy business mogul who   at the start of the picture   breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument   and abruptly takes his friend s car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel    stopping the car along the street   he asks a woman   obviously a prostitute   for directions    agreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks   edward ultimately accepts   they strike up a conversation   and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor    this meeting does not lead to sex   however   as edward confides that he d rather just have someone to talk to   and offers her $300 to spend the night    just as well   since the hooker   named vivian   is a beautiful   generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear    the meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned   when edward finally offers to pay vivian three thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area   keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get togethers    since vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips   which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers   the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act   edward and vivian will finally   truly   kiss    allegedly planned as a grim   downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director     pretty woman   has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale   a la   cinderella      the premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been    you honestly don t need a high iq   or any iq   for that matter   to guess how the film will end   and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha    the supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less than gratifying   and the screenplay is no award winner    and yet   amidst all of these qualms and flaws     pretty woman   is an astoundingly charming motion picture   and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers    you d actually be amazed how far bemusement can go   and there are a few select moments   not even whole scenes   mind you   that are as romantic as anything i ve seen on film in the 1990 s    additionally   the film belongs   and its success can be attributed   to two people and two people only   and they are richard gere and julia roberts    playing sex symbols throughout the  80s with such pictures as   american gigolo   and   an officer and a gentleman     gere branches out here to play a more quiet   almost shy   but still alluring   character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet   and vice versa    julia roberts   in her breakthrough role after 1988 s well received   mistic pizza   and 1989 s   steel magnolia     for which she was nominated for an academy award   is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian   who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers   not for her line of work   but more for her sheer intelligence    it would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake   but screenwriter j   f   lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing    after   pretty woman     roberts   along with meg ryan   became the reigning queen of romantic comedies   with her latest being the just released   runaway bride     which repairs gere and roberts together once again     and no wonder    roberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy   but also one who can efficiently do drama   and in almost every film she appears in   it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co star    an especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co workers that vivian is actually a prostitute   and he then approaches her   making sexual advances    no only does this make vivian feel cheap   especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional   eloquent young lady   but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way   and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading   and if she likes this particular path    on the more dreamy side   the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold   especially one in which edward enters into the hotel s lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress   but also her inner   and outer   glowing beauty    another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward   who is asleep   and placing it on his lips   since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days       pretty woman   does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene   which is a happy ending   as you d expect   and wouldn t have it any other way   that somehow does not work   perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances    this one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film   though   because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem    helped along by a warm   memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo   as vivian s best friend and roommate   and a fabulously catchy soundtrack   in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie s overall fulfillment     pretty woman   is a sparkler of a motion picture   and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy    

Pos, in recent years   harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence   scowling through the likes of tom clancy s jack ryan series    the fugitive    and last year s smash  air force one    that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system    apparently   it was just lying dormant    with ivan reitman s enjoyable romantic comedy/adventure  six days    seven nights    the lovable scoundrel is back   giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons    ford plays quinn harris   a carefree and slightly slobby   endearingly so   pilot in the tropics whose broken down plane crashes in a storm   stranding him and his charter   new york magazine editor robin monroe   anne heche     on a deserted island    of course   the sophisticated robin and the salt of the earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down   and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting    while some of the lines fall flat   the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche    both actors   who have largely done serious works as of late   seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders   and they deliver their zingers   as weak as they sometimes are   with beguiling abandon    naturally   there s nothing like a life threatening crisis to bring two people together   and quinn and robin s warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates    granted   some conflict needed to be introduced on the island   but this tacked on development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes    but the point is to get the two together   and their newfound affection causes complications for both   but mostly robin   who came to the islands on a vacation with her fiance frank   david schwimmer     who frantically awaits her return on the home island    reitman   and old   reliable hand at breezy comedies   keeps the pace brisk and capably handles the more action oriented sequences    his big accomplishment   however   is bringing the old   smiling ford back    as appealing and charismatic as he always is   ford hasn t been quite this charming and affable in years   he s obviously having a blast   and the audience cannot help but have one along with him    holding her own is heche   whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises to be   as the plane goes down   she frantically pops stress pills      she can take her lumps   physical and otherwise   just as well as quinn   making her a formidable foil and ideal match    formulaic and light as a feather    six days    seven nights  could be cited as a classic example of the summer   popcorn   movie season s lack of substance    it s certainly fluff   but it s unpretentious   undemanding   and  most importantly  fun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach    pass the popcorn    

Pos, roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton    this italian film star   best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther   has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust    but benigni s life is beautiful   la vita e bella   is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love   devotion and sacrifice    the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni s guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore    like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him   most notably the almost forgotten harry langdon   benigni s guido has a childlike innocence    he ignores the growing anti semitism of the fascist government    instead   guido ardently falls in love and persues dora   a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official    in benigni s tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate   yet slapstick   encounter    guido wins dora    they marry    fast forward about five years    guido   dora   and their 5 year old son   giosue     giorgio cantarini   are a happy family    guido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore    but racial and anti semitic tensions are on the rise in italy   and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities    the task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp    here   guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son   but to keep him from being exterminated    it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched    for the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror   the pain   the unimaginable suffering of a schindler s list    true   many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over   and most were not sent to the death camps   but to work camps where they were used as slave labor    unlike steven spielberg   benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust    his story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child    for guido   to save his son   transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game    giosue   must follow the rules without question to amass 1   000 points    the winner takes home a tank    therefore   guido tells him   he must remain hidden in the barracks    he cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him    guido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates    guido   lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners   instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive    throughout their imprisonment   guido s quick thinking continually keeps his son from harm s way    ultimately   the allies rescue the camp    in a poignant scene   giosue   comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound    the boy goes wide eyed with wonderment and delight   thinking he has won the game    the price for his victory is most high    benigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell   a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness    life is beautiful is a fantasy   a fable    it is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust    those who object to it are missing its point    and that is simply where there is hope   where there is life and where there is love   the spark of humanity will never be extinguished    committed to lifelong learning through effective communication  

Pos, it was with great trepidation that i approached +mary+   the farrelly brothers+ latest film    i knew the film would be funny  the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see    but i also knew the film would be an equal opportunity offender   attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon    i figured the film would be raunchy   maybe another lucky escapee from nc 17 hell    i may laugh   but would i feel better in the morning    i needn+t have worried    +mary+ is the sweetest   warmest   all out laugh and grossfest this side of  animal house     surprisingly   the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side   and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers    they make laughter   the toughest job for a filmmaker to do   look easy    the plot is typical    thirteen years ago   geeky ted   ben stiller   lucked out in having dazzling mary   cameron diaz   go with him to the senior prom    as luck would have it   on that very day   he was hospitalized    why   i shall not tell   but i assure you   it isn+t pretty    he hires a private investigator to find her   pat healy   matt dillon      he becomes one of the great comic villains    upon finding her   he too is lovestruck   and so pursues her   lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped    it is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double crossed   and goes to get her for himself    would the geek get the girl    puh lease    the ending is pure hollywood   no surprises there    but the absolute joy in this film is how this simple premise allows for humor in zippers   hair gel   the mentally disabled   the physically handicapped   interracial marriages   homosexuals   skin conditions   serial killers   tanning   and drugged up dogs    the dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission   and belongs in the film comedy hall of fame    and yet   for all the targets that are hit   the film maintains its sweet tone    mary   playing the straight role   is as sweet and caring as she is beautiful    she is totally devoted to caring for her mentally handicapped brother   warren   w    earl brown  miles away from the cameraman in  scream       mary+s sunniness carries the film here  it compliments the below belt gags that come at you    cameron diaz makes her totally charming   and the audience respects her   even though women in general do not usually undress before an open window    ben stiller also fares very well   totally changing his image from his  reality bites  and  flirting with disaster  straight men to being a     how to say it       a complete loser    braces   greasy long hair   not too bright   and very very funny    dillon is exceptionally creepy   especially with his capped teeth    and rounding out the cast is ted+s friend dom   chris elliot     tanning addict magda   lin shaye     modern troubador/greek chorus ron lichman   and mary+s sweet mom   markie post   where has she been   !      not everything works    chris elliot+s role   skin blemishes and all   becomes merely tasteless and boring    there+s lousy dialogue about eight minute vs   seven minute exercise tapes    and there are long stretches without much going on    but the wait is worth it    when those extraordinary sequences hit   the entire theater erupted with howls   tears    belly aches   that in some sequences carried over to the following scene    the farrelly brothers have finally done it    yes   there are some raunchy bits   but when it is all over   it+s not nearly as bad as it could have been    while tasteless   it didn+t cross any lines   at least not with me    while raunchy   it wasn+t nearly as bad as  porky+s  or  boogie nights     and it is sweet enough to be considered a date flick    after the funny but sour  kingpin  left a negative aftertaste in my palate   comes the funniest sex farce since  a fish called wanda     approach this with an open mind   and you will reap the benefits hugely    

Pos, i know what i would do with $4   4 million if i found it in a previously undiscovered airplane crash site   especially if i were with jacob and lou       huh      well   in any event   that is the situation hank   paxton   finds himself in    he and his dim witted brother jacob   thorton   and tubby friend lou   brent briscoe   come upon a large bag of cash inside a plane wreck    against his better judgement   hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities    the rest of the film is a question of who is going to die to keep this a secret   and is it worth it    a simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things   clay pigeons and even fargo   and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle    oh   and its much better than any of those    sam raimi took a departure from his normal freak show horror monkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture    he really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do    i think raimi knew he had a winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on a natural flowing course    one of the film s components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malick s the thin red line    in malick s three hour bore a thon   he makes an interesting attempt to link mother earth to his war story    it seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to a field of flowing grass   a small bird   or a flowing body of water    sure   there were obvious metaphorical connections   but there was no subtlty to his efforts    raimi does a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters    i think most viewers may miss the comparison   but it is a very intriguing ingredient in the film    and then there s billy bob thorton   who is proof that the independent film industry is vital to the life blood of hollywood    if it can continute to produce people like thorton   hollywood will be ok    he gives a fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here    it is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade   but is is just as complex   if not more so    jacob is slow and simple   and yet we so often see him deep in thought    i wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never say   or didn t know how to say   or if he was just taking a long time to think about the thing he just said    here he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry    though the plot is somewhat unoriginal   it has a very appealing new twist in its characters    paxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group   a far cry from chet in wierd science      perhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advice giving wife   but she certainly doesn t do anything ruin the picture    a simple plan can be included in the group of recent small hollywood films that is just dark and pretty un redeeming    but at least this one has an important message   unlike so many of its counterparts    

Pos, susan granger s review of   osmosis jones     warner bros      if the farrelly brothers taught anatomy & physiology in school   no one would cut ever class    this hip   live action/animation story begins as a monkey snatches a hard boiled egg from frank   a zookeeper   bill murray     who grabs it back   drops it   then gobbles up the contaminated morsel   explaining     if it hits and ground and you pick it up within 10 seconds   you can eat it      like   fantastic voyage     1966     the pseudo science animation then takes over when his body s immune system contacts traffic control as an ingested virus hits the digestive system     be on the alert for illegal organisms !    eager to right   a stomach evacuation mistake   he once made   a cocky   clever   courageous white blood cell   chris rock   declares     this is a crime scene !    and teams up with a conscientious   phi beta capsule   12 hour cold remedy called drixenol   david hyde pierce   to chase down and destroy the deadly   red death   virus   laurence fishburne   that s determined to take frank down in 48 hours   beating ebola and e   coli to a medical record    watch out for mucus mudslides   chaos in cerebellum hall and the detritus from booger dam   runny nose     along with comic turns from molly shannon and chris elliot   plus the voices of william shatner and brandy norwood    peter and bobby farrelly   along with writer mark hyman and animation directors piet kroon and tom sito   have turned their penchant for gross out comedy   encompassing flatulence   festering sores and   popping a pimple without a permit     into a funny   farrelly funny family film    on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10     osmosis jones   is a wildly imaginative   original   explosive 7    and perhaps   as they re laughing   kids will learn where to find their uvula   along with nuggets about nutrition and hygiene    

Pos,    when will the devil take me     he asks rhetorically in lulling voice over    the spoiled title character of  onegin    pronounced oh negg in   is waiting on death to relieve him after a lifetime of rapacious behaviour    martha fiennes  debut feature is   quite literally   filmed poetry   it s based on an epic russian poem by alexander pushkin     a profound study of regret   of how we confuse shame with guilt    when we first meet eugene onegin   ralph   acting for his sister   another brother   magnus   composed the score     a philandering aristocrat from st   petersburg   he has just inherited his uncle s estate    with plans to sell it   onegin pays a summer visit to the manor   which is located in an underpopulated russian countryside   and not long into the trip he meets a neighbouring family of blue bloods    smitten with olga larina   headey     he befriends olga s fianc     vladimir lensky   stephens     while olga s sister   tatyana   tyler     romanticizing his flippant attitude   he s a nineteenth bad boy     falls for onegin    in one sweaty   inky torrent of passion   tatyana writes him a love letter    he is at least intrigued by the note but rejects her affections   it is implied   because he can    soon after   tragedy strikes   and onegin makes himself scarce    when we catch up with him   six years later   he has just returned to st   petersburg   where at a grand ball he discovers that an old friend   donovan   has married a more womanly and wordly tatyana    this time   onegin finds her irresistable    what is most amazing about ralph fiennes  performance is his subtle physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch    overwhelmed by a top hat   the onegin who pines for tatyana seems smaller in stature than the one who brushed her off   an ebeneezer scrooge trapped in christmas past    the actor has been constricted playing heroes for too long now there s room to breathe in a role that s made up of shades of gray like   onegin      petula clark sang of a universal phenomenon in   parking lot       you don t know what you ve got   til it s gone      onegin s about face on tatyana speaks for those of us   read   most of us   who need confirmation that someone or something is wanted by others before we want it as well    what the character feels is not jealousy but remorse   embarrassment   even   at having let her go    out of identification we feel empathy for onegin   a callous bastard    tatyana s emotions echo a thousand ditties   but that makes them no less vital    she changes   too   from a girl in crush to a woman with divided loyalties    tyler acquits herself surprisingly well among her uk co stars   filling in sketchy gaps by expressing base sentiments in a series of wanton stares    they both have faces   mr   fiennes and ms   tyler   capable of conveying archetypal russian misery     onegin  could have added up to little more than a distinguished episode of   masterpiece theater     even with its current cast of thoroughbreds intact   were martha fiennes not at the helm    an mtv background   she cut her teeth directing rock videos for xtc and others   has positively influenced her sense of pace   though   thankfully   not her shot lengths no spasmodic cutting here     at just over 100 minutes    onegin  clicks along like a brisk walk through valleys of despair    the film has an atypical period look   as well    absent are the sumptuous tableware and antique furnishings that stand in for plot and character in those drippy merchant ivory productions    the sets are almost expressionistically bare   echoing the loneliness of the protagonists       cinematographer remi adafarasin often allows space to engulf them   i m reminded the climax   which unfolds in a sea of white      martha fiennes has a clear command of cinema   and her spare   often painfully human visual presentation of   yevgeny onegin   is arguably the most lucid translation of pushkin s difficult text yet    ms   fiennes may be the most exciting female presence behind a camera since jane campion    

Pos, the happy bastard s 30 second review  big daddy  happy gilmore as a father    of course !  that s the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy   a movie that s passable but isn t really considered some of sandler s best work    he doesn t actually play happy gilmore in the movie   but a variation of him    he s sonny coufax   a man who s living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot and his one day a week gig as a tollbooth man   tollbooth willie        his girlfriend   kristy swanson   is fed up with his lifestyle and demands a change before she leaves him    enter a 5 year old kid   who s mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate   jon stewart     who s off in china on a business trip    from there   coufax basically acts as the kid s father   teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a building and tripping up skateboarders with sticks    he even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautiful law office worker   joey lauren adams     but   somehow   he also garners the attention of social services   who aren t particularly pleased with coufax s actions   as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid    the reason i say it s not really sandler s best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie   showing some odd feelings that somehow didn t really belong in a sandler vehicle    i mean   it fits the movie s tone and everything   and sandler handles it well   but it s just oddly placed   that s all    fortunately   it doesn t destroy the goofy glee path it s been following and it still makes you feel good    sandler does a good job here   as he does in most of his movies    rob schneider   however   is irritating as his friend   an immigrant delivery boy who can t read    stewart   in his minor time on screen   is great   and adams remains a joy to watch    look for steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum    he s a hoot    directed by dennis dugan   director of happy gilmore     the movie remains a good couple of hours to pass the time with    again   there are faults   but   hey   everyone needs to get emotional sometimes    

Pos, the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen king s work    this slow moving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals   but suffers from a tepid conclusion   inconsistent direction   and may not have wide commercial appeal    when the maid   dolores claiborne   is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer   it seems like an open and shut murder case    upon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax   dolores  estranged and bitter daughter   esquire magazine writer selena st   george   returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home    as the two clash horns   the story behind the mysterious death of dolores  abusive husband two decades ago   ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey   is revealed    did dolores kill her husband    and did she kill her employer    dolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller    consequently   it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywood s finest character actors   such as bates   leigh and strathairn    kathy bates plays the film s title character   and gives a sensational lead performance    dolores claiborne is essentially a showcase for the talent of bates   as her character has a huge amount of screen time    she dominates the screen   producing a character that is compelling and arresting   as we watch the character go through two decades of history via flashbacks    kathy bates  performance is award calibre stuff    the rest of the cast is also very good    jennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour   bitter helena st   george well   and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores  ever present nemesis   the determined detective john mackey    david strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and despicable as dolores  husband   joe st   george    judy parfitt is fine as dolores  tyrannic socialite employer   vera donovan  it would have been interesting to see   say   meg foster in this role    child actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences   she is very impressive    the direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the film   ranging from some parts which are quite clever in their own right   to parts which are embarrassingly hokey    the segues between flashbacks and the present are very hit and miss in terms of effectiveness    the pacing of the film tends to be numbingly slow   which tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up    however   the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderful  i particularly like the chilling ice blue hue permeating the present day scenes   contrasting well with the many nova scotia ocean shots  and danny elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for the film    it would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited    none of the performers in the film could be classified as a big draw   and its pacing may be a turn off to those expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists and turns and car crashes and axe wielding psychopaths    although being essentially the only film in its genre in release now   it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works   even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption and the stand    dolores claiborne suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion   and moves very slowly    however   the performances are uniformly excellent   particularly kathy bates   and the film has its moments    on my four star scale   i give dolores claiborne three stars    

Pos, the film   magnolia   can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests    the dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower    they all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart    the numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially    from a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host   each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain    they are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness    whether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse   each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one       magnolia   is a clever   well thought out film from prodigy director writer paul thomas anderson of   boogie nights   fame    the detailed character analyses and the powerful script make   magnolia   memorable    however   what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories   the film is never confusing    anderson s control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful    he also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of   magnolia s   scenes drag on too long    any three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending    from the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn t get boring    it is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot    this is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation    every character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees    for example   cop john c   reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall s daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly    the fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes   races   and genders suffer    anderson s explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing    the only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously    this was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get    the performances in   magnolia   are perfection    this is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting    anderson allows many of hollywood s best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best   character acting    all of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film    worth noting is tom cruise   who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance    he was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past   however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints   the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon s character as phillip baker hall s wife    she seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film       magnolia   uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters    anderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours    to see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity    diversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time    i predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future    

Pos, that s the question i asked myself when venturing nervously into   the wedding singer     the latest film to star the saturday night live alumnus    does he draw laughs from his sad   puppy dog expression and don t hate me for being a simpleton observations    or do fans giggle when he screams at the top of his lungs at people    or is it just the fact that he sings songs with silly lyrics that bowl audiences over    well   there s a little bit of all of that in   the wedding singer   and while i exited the theater still not one hundred percent sure of mr   sandler s thing   i did have a surprisingly good time    that s because   in a nutshell     the wedding singer   is one of the sweetest movies you re ever likely to come across    that s right    sweet    the humor in the film runs the gamut from dumb to mildly amusing to laugh out loud hysterical but the tone    well   it s just lovely    i have to admit i was half expecting farting armpit humor   gratuitous nudity   superfluous   cloying subplots   and some nasty   unnecessary violence    instead    well   i ve said it before    sweet    the year is 1985 and sandler plays robbie hart   the eponymous wedding singer   a job aspiring rock stars often settle for    when robbie s fianc   e dumps him at his own altar   robbie gets depressed and turns to a plucky waitress called julia   drew barrymore   who has some problems of her own   she s marrying a hunky junk bonds dealer who   unbeknownst to her   isn t that big on monogamy      it isn t giving anything away to say that robbie and julia fall in love    aww        sandler and barrymore are a good match and they re assisted by some terrific cameo appearances   including steve buscemi and jon lovitz   whose individual scenes are perhaps the funniest in the film    writer tim herlihy   with uncredited assistance from carrie fisher   keeps the story bubbling along to its predictable conclusion    it doesn t all work but it s handled with such light heartedness that robbie and julia coming together generates more smiles than groans    herlihy and director frank coraci have done a great job of recreating the sights   sounds   and affectations of the 1980s    the soundtrack  an ever present force in the film  is packed with wall to wall hits of the period   new wave upon new wave of songs from billy idol s   white wedding   to the smiths    how soon is now      to culture club s   do you really want to hurt me      the mix of music and fashion would make   the wedding singer   a great double feature with   boogie nights      if you grew up listening to the cure and a flock of seagulls and the psychedelic furs   then   the wedding singer   is bound to put a nostalgic hop in your stride    if you re a fan of the lovable   laughable adam sandler   well        let s just say that   the wedding singer   might well be the only film in recent memory to make * me * want to rent   happy gilmore      

Pos, you may not have heard of lucas   or if you have   you might not think much of it    probably because it stars corey haim   or maybe because it s about a little geek who collects insects   or maybe because it doesn t feature slick one liners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80 s    however   you have been missing out on a true masterpeice   the best film of 1986   and the best film about adolescent life ever made    corey haim stars as lucas bligh   a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair   thick glasses   and an interest in insects and other outdoor life    one day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him    her name is maggie   a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty   with lovely red hair and a sweet   innocent complexion    maggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her   but somehow he interests her   and soon they are talking and getting to know one another    they gradually become good friends   and spend the summer together doing various things   such as studying insects   namely locusts   who come out of hiding once every 17 years     playing tennis   and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover    lucas is obviously in love with maggie   and while she is charmed by him   it s clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend    this is not clear to lucas   however    he still beleives that maggie is his soulmate   and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what s about to happen    we soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally    they throw him on stage   right in front of his beloved maggie    surprisingly   he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around   but he takes it too far   and is embarassed in front of the entire school    the next scene is brilliant    maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally    she tries to talk to him as if nothing happened    he rails back against her   in a cruel unfair fashion    in lesser movies this would ve turned into a confrontation between the two characters    but maggie is written smarter than that    she understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him    next we are introduced to another great character named cappie   charlie sheen      he is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend    what s interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks    of course anyone with a brain can tell what s gonna happen next    cappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas  relationship    this begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone    she s been assigned to show him how to operate the washer/dryer so he can clean his shirt    maggie is charmed by cappie s tender undertsanding demeanor   not to mention his shirtless body    this scene is so delicate and sweet   but cappie still has a girlfriend   preventing either one from acting on their desires    desperately trying to puncture the tension   cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room    it s not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend   in the films only subpar scene      lucas finally figures out what s going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance    this causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself   such as try out for the football team    the last third of the film revolves around this attempt    while the idea seems cliched   the way it is executed is not    there are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up    dave grusin s memorable score   played at the perfect moments   certainly helps    lucas is filled with great performances    forget everything you know about corey haim    back in 1986 he had talent   and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3 dimensional performance filled with anger   humor   and pain    kerri green is very appealing as maggie   showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her    sheen s cappie is almost too good to be true   but sheen makes him beleivable   especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas    there are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popitti s ben   a friend of lucas   whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks    also turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina   the girl who admires lucas from afar    when people talk about the great teen angst films of the 80s   you hear john hughes this and john hughes that    lucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his so called classics    but hopefully   like with heathers and say anything   lucas can begin to find it s own loyal following and help people realize there were more to the 80s than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald    it deserves more than that   but i don t want to be greedy    

Pos, while watching boiler room   i was constantly reminded of last year s masterpiece fight club    both films consist of a predominately male cast    both films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires    and both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator   who eventually realizes that these men have to be stopped    while boiler room writer/director ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club   he does contribute another impressive work to a series of films aiming to represent the new generation    a generation which has seen the internet prosper and where everyone wants to be a millionaire    paying homage to oliver stone s 1987 classic wall street   younger is almost modernizing the tale by using younger   hipper actors to play the greedy villains as opposed to the older   more experienced types    as is true in real life   younger minds are becoming richer and richer from their knowledge of more standard technology    boiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity and shows that greed and desire for power come in all ages    another similarity with fight club is that both films are not action flicks    some people are convinced that an all male cast automatically means there must be gory violence   here is proof that this is not true    if you want to see an action movie starring ben affleck   go see reindeer games this weekend    if you want to see a smart   insightful film with excellent acting and a clever script   see boiler room    giovanni ribisi gives an outstanding performance as the film s narrator   seth    after dropping out of college and running a lucrative gambling center for college students in his apartment   seth is offered a high paying job by a wealthy man   nicky katt      he agrees to take the job   in which you are guaranteed to become a millionaire within three years   of selling stock to well off americans from the mid west over the telephone and begins to fit in quite well with his co workers    learning tricky techniques to deceive innocent people into buying shares of a good in production   seth figures this is too good to be true    after stumbling into a room at the wrong time   he knows there is something no good about this company    at this point   seth is left with the ultimate choice   continue with the american dream and make millions or tell the authorities that something fishy is going on    ribisi is believable as seth especially when he shares scenes with ron rifkin   playing seth s dad    the two have perfect chemistry as a troubled father and son trying to impress each other and simultaneously impress themselves    the transitions from anger to sympathy that these scenes contain are the standout segments of the entire film    the supporting cast of greedy co workers is also flawless    ben affleck shines in a short but sweet performance as a recruiter for the company   nicky katt is fabulous as the ostensibly friendly boss who eventually becomes extremely jealous of seth   and vin diesel gives his best performance of his career as the foil character of nicky katt    the energy of the cast as a whole makes boiler room well paced and never boring    the only major error in the film is that nothing major happens    there is no big plot twist or climatic point to make the film more memorable    due to the lack of a major event   boiler room never finds a suitable genre to fit into    the movie is not intense enough to be a thriller   the romantic segments involving seth and abby   nia long   are not properly finalized   and the dialogue isn t funny enough to make it a comedy    in having trouble to characterize the movie as a whole   boiler room is slightly confused at times    it doesn t seem to know which category to fit itself into    one satisfying concluding scene could have changed the whole film for the better    otherwise   the movie is fun to watch thanks to its lively cast of young actors    

Pos, ok   let s get one thing straight right away   maximum risk is no battleship potemkin   although it does have some russians in it !     but it s not too bad   really    it s the new film from ringo lam   the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood   and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium   jean claude van damme   who   you will recall   also starred in john woo s maiden hollywood effort   hard target      in lam s film   van damme plays alain moreau   a french cop   at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target   who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians    these russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york   where   i suppose   they thought they wouldn t be noticed      this brother   mikhail suverov   played in his few scenes by       well    you know     becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi   almost the same thing   i guess     and is killed in france   in the movie   things happen so fast that you don t have too much time to think about how weird this all is      moreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed   and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed   we wonder the same thing   i still do      in little odessa   he meets mikhail s girlfriend   alex   natasha henstridge   last seen in species     who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the mise en scene   she has very nice breasts   and we get to seen them briefly in this movie   it was rated r in the us but is pg here   so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do      this film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow   the fugitive   hard target   or anything starring arnold   but that works to its benefit   i think    after all   one thing that s been missing from woo s hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love   well   some of us do      movies like this shouldn t be too pretentious   and that is part of the problem with some of these other films   they try to be too   big   in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle    maximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions   but they don t overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative   not too much   anyway      the emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions   even if   at times   they don t make a hell of a lot of sense      in fact   one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character   a rather overeager new york cabbie   frank van keeken from tv s   kids in the hall       who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story    unfortunately   by the time we have come to really get interested in him   he       well    you ll see    the movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots    one is a fight in a russian sauna   with lots of sweaty   muscular male flesh   this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience more than others     bullets in heads   and vodka    another   my personal favorite   is a fight in a meat packing house   featuring pig carcasses and a chainsaw    and even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than hollywood   as they trash those quaint french cafes   vegetable carts   and   well   french people that   we all know in our hearts   deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint    of course   the movie does have its share of silliness    for example   while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he s getting   alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror with which he has been whacking the guy on the head    in an unnecessarily dramatic moment   he apparently is shocked at what he sees   at what he has become    but what has he become    a tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him    doesn t sound too unreasonable to me   considering the genre    but let s face it   any time van damme tries to be dramatic   he looks silly    so maximum risk is a little different from most other action films    while watching it   i was surprised   and a little disappointed   in the relative lack of pyrotechnics    but watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush   after the initial excitement   there s not much left    although it s short on spectacle   lam s film leaves a better and more lasting impression   i think    i m more impressed by it now than i was while watching it   and to me   that s a good sign    go see maximum risk   but don t expect a typical hollywood action movie   expect a sort of funky hong kong hollywood action movie    the flying inkpot rating system   * wait for the tv2 broadcast     * * a little creaky   but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good   bring a friend     * * * * amazing   potent stuff     * * * * * perfection    see it twice    dr t   white teaches film at the english language and literature department of the national university of singapore   but we don t hold this against him    

Pos, this film is based on the campy tv show from the 1960 s under the same appellation    mind you   most people   including yours truly   who will see this movie will not have seen any episodes from the original series    the movie is really a stand alone in that regard    the family robinson       lost in space    plot   set in the year 2058   the family robinson is chosen to sail out into space in search of other planets that might contain the natural resources earth needs in order to survive its future    a colonization process   if you will    they are joined by able pilot west   leblanc     and evil uninvited stowaway   oldman     who does not want to see the trip conclude on a successful tip    eventually   their trek goes awry   and all are   lost in space         how do get back to earth      is the question that infests the rest of this sci fi epic    critique   this film reminded me a lot of the fifth element   6   5/10   from the summer of 1997    it s a film with a lot of flash   but very little actual substance    admittedly   there isn t an annoying character like chris tucker from the other film   but this film does run a little too long   and did lose me in regards to its complex time travel / multi dimensional story line    having said that   the special effects in this movie were amazing   and the overall look and feel were also way above average    you really felt like you were in the future   and riding through space with these poor souls    unfortunately for this chosen family   their 10 year old son is the smartest one in the group   and the father is too wrapped up in his work to notice the rest of his family   ever heard that one before    yawn !      the acting is ok   and i was especially surprised at the solid performance by tv friend s matt leblanc who shows us all that he s definitely more than just a pretty face    on the down side   the family riff raff that cuts through most of the picture is lame and time consuming   even though we gotta give them credit for   trying   to develop characters in a sci fi pic     the story line is hard to follow   the evil character in the movie actually tells people that he s   evil     and the movie goes on for about 20 minutes too long    on the slick side   many of the special effects are really cool   the sequence in which the family is   paralyzed   during the hyper drive is awesome   and the animated monkey that joins the family halfway through the flic is mucho cool     the credit presentation at the end of the film is slamming   and the adventures that they fall into are somewhat thrilling   i will also admit that   somehow   they got me to semi tear up near the conclusion of this picture         very  odd                overall   if you re a big sci fi fan   check this movie out for the special effects and challenging narrative   and if you re not   i would still suggest seeing this movie   but then you could probably wait until it comes out on video so that you forward past some of the boring parts    little known facts   this film will always be remembered as the movie that knocked titanic   7/10   out of the top spot at the box office after 15 straight weeks at number one    garry oldman is british   and was once married to uma thurman for about six months    mimi rogers was tom cruise s first wife    

Pos, it is simply amazing how   the green mile   developed in its three hour running time    based on the stephen king series of the same title   the film starts out painfully slow   with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue    however   as the plot begins to progress   the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction    frank darabont   who masterfully followed a prisoner s story in   the shawshank redemption     this time follows the perspective of a prison guard   paul edgecomb   tom hanks      through edgecomb s experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent   the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law    from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner     the green mile   is successful in creating sympathy for kind hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners    the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them    the performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb    the ensemble acting in the film is perfect    hanks   david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles    they are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles    they are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience    the more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting    some particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson   sam rockwell   and michael duncan    hutchinson   playing percy wetmore   a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie    every time he appears on the screen   the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying    it would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor   not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore   but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks    rockwell   an independent film veteran   plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection    as a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours   he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others    this irritation he creates makes his performance so believable    the last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan   as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill    duncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child like behemoth   very similar to lennie small in of mice and men    his desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause    his pain creates pain for the viewer    however   it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film    the film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at   the jerry springer show      the scene   containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks    not only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place   but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief    as the film flashes back to 1935   graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction    his death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is   the scene is neither sad nor convincing    greene is not even given a final word   like some of the other characters   and we don t even see him walk the infamous green mile    however   as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters   such as coffey and eduard delacroix   michael jeter   as well as the five prison guards   the film becomes more interesting    the speed in   the green mile   is perfect    if time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark   it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others    the three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film   a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character       the green mile   is so good following the rough beginning   that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes   it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene    fighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing    if you survive the first third of   the green mile   sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment    

Pos, synopsis   shrek   myers   is an ogre living in contented solitude deep in the heart of a forest   until his home is invaded by fairy tale creatures fleeing the rule of the evil lord farquaad   john lithgow      farquaad agrees to relocate the pests   on the condition that shrek rescues princess fiona   diaz      whom farquaad desires to wed    from a far off castle    grudgingly   shrek sets out   joined in his quest by an unwanted companion   donkey   murphy      review   one memorable aspect of disney s   aladdin   was that it finally gave robin williams a character    the genie    to best take advantage of his comic talents       shrek   does the same for eddie murphy   ironically   though   murphy s ideal vessel turns out to be an ass    all the same     shrek   does represent murphy s best comic outing in years   and as donkey he steals all the best lines    for instance   after getting belted with pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature   donkey soars into the air and scoffs     now i m a flying talking donkey !    and despite its many contributors   the script for   shrek   is full of such comic gems    myers is delightful in more of a straight man role   and lithgow also gets some great moments   watch for a hilarious repartee with the gingerbread man         shrek   takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy tales and nursery rhymes of all sorts   and reserves a few delightful knocks at disney in the bargain    things do go somewhat astray during the film s middle segment   which concentrates too much on the main characters at the expense of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which is the movie s greatest strength    but even then   one can always sit back and enjoy the beautiful computer animation   whose remarkable use here represents yet another dazzling leap forward for the technology    

Pos, john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles    so effortlessly that people tend to forget he s there   much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors   anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor s face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors      example   the other day my mother asked me   the expert   of course   if there were any movies out worth seeing   never mind that our tastes couldn t be more divergent    i ll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes   and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go !  was a lot of fun   which it is     so i didn t see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation    i muttered   with a little trepidation   that she might enjoy high fidelity    she responded with her usual query     whose in that one      this is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see    if the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light   a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing   and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people   usually of the jewish faith   fretting about in some upper east side palace    anyway   when i answered   john cusack     she replied with a rather stunned   who       as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to    now i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies   most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin   but i suppose it s understandable that she would not recognize the name   after all   for most   names are tougher than faces    i showed her a picture of cusack s mug in the paper hoping for an   oh   him   yes he s quite good   instead i got a   no   i don t know him      at this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger   yes   filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone     till i realized something   i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack s relatively bland visage   or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise   one syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car    cu sack   cu sack   no   not quite as cool    i m sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as   the guy from   add in the cusack film of your choice        he s not a brand name   and his movies usually aren t big moneymakers   but in his own unassuming way he s kind of a genius    with his pleasant   common man looks   and charming semi articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90 s    from the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon    despite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it   the schlumpy every man     he s a constantly enjoyable screen persona   like albert brooks or woody allen    and he knows how to chose scripts   while the stephan baldwin s and val kilmer s seem to put them selves in everything   the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle   and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent     cusack generally picks rewarding projects   save for the unwatchable hot pursuit   a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller      high fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears   the grifters   the hi lo country     and it s a hit    it was also co written by cusack   and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy   grosse point blank    it s not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film   but as it progresses in its meandering fashion   the movie cast something of a spell over me    high fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non committal rob   a vinyl record store owner   who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his   top 5 break ups list      this is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller s day off    at first the talking directly into the camera schtick had me vaguely annoyed   mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit   but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack s witty delivery    he s the kind of guy we don t mind talking directly to us    gradually the film settles into a shampoo like tragi comic character study   of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is   yes it s all very existential      though that plot line is mostly enjoyable   the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters   all of whom   now this is really something   are terrific enough to warrant their own films    the best of which is jack black   of the very funny show tenacious d   a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis  hair       unfortunately that annoying smirk remains     an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy    he s the kind of guy i m sure we ve all met before   a blowhard who thinks he s always right and will do anything in his power   be it yell   argue   insult   to hoist his opinion onto others    but i like this guy   because of how black plays him    the actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes   but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak   which might be a bit of a redundant description   seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic      he s the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films       look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister      but fears and black never let that happen    the character   for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality    he s over the top   but in a way we can all probably relate to    catherine zeta jones   in her brief role   gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own   charm      tim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age type   a character played entirely for cartoon yuks   but still manages to work its desired comic effect    the one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy   the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle   mifune     who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent   replacing it with a stilted american phonation    i give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role   but instead of being likeable   she comes across as rather robotic   and as such it s hard to see why cusack s character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful   intelligent writer   natasha gregson wagner   potentially waiting in the wings    this reminded me of say anything   where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye   and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood   whose unbelievably more wooden then father   clint for those   special people   whose wheels turn a little slower      in fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his   though i d bet that if laura and natasha switched roles   the result would be more effective    high fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances    fears  direction is somewhat stilted   and the script is sometimes a little too   and this is a word i m beginning to hate to use but alas i must   quirky for its own good   i think i ll blame that on scott rosenberg   who judging from what he did with beautiful girls   con air   and things to do in denver while your dead   has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie      but cusack really does deserve an award   for being so damn       cusackian    i m afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent    his character   rob   whose sort of like an older   more bitter lloyd from say anything   is funny and tragic without being pathetic   and that cusack can do all this   and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences   is something of an achievement    

Pos, now   lets first look into the history of shark films    there was the unforgettable jaws    the exciting jaws 2   the rather flaky jaws 3d and sometime in the late 90s another film of the same genre that i can t seem to recall   about the son of jaws returning to wreak revenge or something like that      now   with the magic of cgi   one shark is simply not enough   in deep blue sea   there are 3 big   mean and really smart ones !  russell frankiln   jackson   visits aquatica   a sea bound research center     where a research is being conducted on the extraction of a hormone substance found uniquely within the shark brain that can cure and reverse the effects of alzheimer s disease    the substance is small in quantity and because of this   lead researcher dr   susan macalaester genetically alters the shark dna and grows them twice the size with brains as big as humans   naturally producing more of the much treasured hormones    as sure as the sun sets in the west   a shark breaks lose and wreaks havoc within the facility during a hormone extraction procedure    with the flexibility offered by cgi   the sharks get more full length screen time as their predecessors did in those remote controlled rubber suit days    gone are the days of people getting pulled under the water with the water turning red right after    this time   we get to see the entire gobbling action   with floating limbs and all    so so acting   expected in most of your average action film    jackson   fresh from his jedi master role in the phantom menace     takes on the dark side force of a different kind and fits well with his wise cracking lines    ll cool j s cook role as preacher   does for this film what steven seagal s cook could only dream to achieve in his two under siege films    deep blue sea does not offer any of the psychological thrills that jaws has to offer    it does however   prove to be a refreshing follow up within the genre   full of visual thrills   suspense and believe it or not  humour !  its like jurassic park under water    nothing too stressful   pure entertainment    renny harlin   you are forgiven   for making cutthroat island

Pos, i remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at cannes over a year ago   picking up the grand jury prize at the festival     holocaust comedy receives standing ovation    the headlines read    intrigued by this statement   i looked up information on the film and found that   sure enough   life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years    even though the movie was extremely well received by critics and public alike   i couldn t help but be disgusted at this notion   human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated    only now do i see the error of my ways    after finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time   it became clear that it is not   as the headlines proclaimed   a   holocaust comedy     on the contrary   life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps    rather   it focuses on the relationship between a father and his son   who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation    roberto benigni   who also wrote and directed the movie   stars as guido orefice   a chaplin inspired clown and all round jolly guy who   as the film opens   is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher   nicoletta braschi   benigni real life spouse      through the course of the first hour or so   we see guido striving to get the attention of this   beautiful princess     as he calls her    employing the magic of laughter   the italian comedian wins her heart and together   they raise a young boy named giosue   child actor giorgio cantarini      life treats them well until hitler s minions rise to power   and the family is whisked away to a german camp   where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his son s innocence no matter what the sacrifice    granted   it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the concentration camp   but it does not pull a   hogan s heros   and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews    somehow   it achieves hilarity without disrespecting it s gravely serious subject    so   we ve established that life is beautiful is not a   holocaust comedy      but   there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me    the film   despite critic s declarations of it being a   triumph of the human spirit     is no such thing   not in my eyes   anyway    some have called the story an   affirmation of the beauty of life     but i say it is a very dark and bleak statement about man s capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy    the film s ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently   but i found it to be truly discerning and upsetting    essentially   life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of film    however   i am not denying the movie s greatness    believe me   it s fantastic    i m just saying that i think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as    but perhaps i m reading more into the movie than is really there    maybe the film s brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit    in fact   maybe roberto benigni has made a film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out of a movie exactly what you put into it    

Pos, most movies seem to release a third movie just so it can be called a trilogy    rocky iii seems to kind of fit in that category   but manages to be slightly unique    the rocky formula of   rocky loses fight/rocky trains/rocky wins fight   is carried out to the letter    also the  tradition  of showing the last five minutes or so from the past rocky film is used as well    this movie begins with a series of clips showing how famous rocky   sylvester stallone   has become        even showing a brief appearance on sesame street ! !  then it moves on with rocky being in a fixed fight with thunderlips   hulk hogan      a mysterious bad ass known as clubber lang   mr   t   trash talks to rocky about his stupid decision to retire from boxing and that he   pities the fool   for not coming out and fighting him outright    rocky s trainer   burgess meredith   tells rocky not to fight   but the italian stallion doesn t listen    naturally   he gets his ass kicked    somewhere along the line after this several things happen    rocky s longtime trainer dies   causing rocky to train with his former opponent apollo creed    rocky s wife complains to her husband that he should fight    the final fight ensues between clubber and rocky    guess who wins    the winner s name rhymes with  smocky     the movie is entertaning mainly because of clubber lang s over the top performance    the dramatic aspect has been toned down considerably since rocky ii and now action seems to be the strong point of the film    which is good if you like fighting scenes    the last match is quite decent actually    if you liked the previous films   rent this one    it s well worth seeing if you are a fan of the series    but if you can t stand rocky shouting   adrianne ! ! !    one more time   see something else    

Pos, in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because   in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen style   earnestly shallow gen x angst pictures   it seemed to be actually about something    it angered people   started arguments outside the theater   riled things up    it ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film    having endured my share of the hype   i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside   and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about    does men live up to its press    well   yes it does    and it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office    for the uninitiated   newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard   two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment    chad and howard are archetypes   examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business    chad is the blond golden boy   genetically engineered for success   the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder    howard is chad s boss   but he is weaker of will   the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent    we first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge    there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain   he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office   woo her simultaneously   win her love   and then dump her    the reason    both men have recently been dumped themselves   and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex       it ll restore a little dignity to our lives     he says    howard   helpless against the force of chad s will   agrees to the plan    they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine   stacy edwards     a fragile deaf woman working as a temp    chad moves in for the kill   flashing his golden boy smile   plying christine with lunch   then flowers   then dinner    howard follows suit   though his efforts are in contrast ham handed and desperate    flattered to have the attention of two eligible men   christine dates them both    you can guess which one she falls for    soon a tragic lovers  triangle develops   christine loves chad   chad loves himself   and howard loves christine on the grounds that   since she s handicapped and shy   she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him    adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high   does it    in chad   writer/director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film hannibal lector may eat human flesh   but chad is an eater of souls    his evil is as subtle as a viper s   and as easy as his smile    we watch in stunned disbelief as he back stabs coworkers   humiliates his subordinates   and works his deadly venom into christine s heart    his character would be a joke if he wasn t so chillingly real  all of us have worked with a chad   and some of us may be him    he s the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness    if one of his co workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns   he had best have his escape route clearly in mind    politics is his game   and the modern cubicle filled office is his playground    men wears the guise of a black comedy   but it functions best as allegory    the most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company   then forces him to prove it in a manner i won t describe    the scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril    could it happen in the real world    probably not    taken as allegory   however   it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society    maybe it s just the english major in me   but chad   in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard   can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism   of greed without conscience    the entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism  only the strong will survive    the marvel of labute s multi layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way    but does the film work as entertainment    its darned funny in spots   particularly in the men s room scenes   which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions    it works less well as drama   since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers    stacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine   and succeeds in making us care for her   but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her    likewise   chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions    by the end of the film you ll feel as if you ve met a genuine monster in chad   perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film    certainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed    but the picture is often mesmerizing   and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship   which makes it well worth your time    like all good films   it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world    while watching chad in his moment of triumph   i couldn t help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold   merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs    there may be a little bit of chad in all of us   but some of us have taken chad ness to the level of art    

Pos, why do people hate the spice girls       what exactly have they done wrong   other than perhaps offend the fashion police       so what if they are not   great   singers   they ain t singing opera   folks   its pop music !     who exactly is a   great   singer    judging by that opening paragraph it is obvious that i like the spice girls       they do what they do  sing some catchy tunes  and they do it pretty well       they are able to carry that into their first film     spice world           spice world   certainly isn t a great filmgoing experience            what it is what the spice girls are all about   fun   songs   and a lot of   girl power !    drawing from a number of different films   like the beatles    hard day s night       spice world   chronicles the week heading up to the girls  first concert at london s albert hall       they get to tool around london in a big ol  bus   driven by meat loaf !   and generally have fun       in order to through a semblence of plot into the film   there is an evil tabloid publisher played by barry humphries   better known to americans   for about 15 minutes   as dame edna   remember her         he wants to sabotage the girls  concert so he can sell papers    of course   the point in a movie like   spice world   isn t plot       the center of the film is the spice girls themselves   ginger   the recently departed geri haliwell     posh   victoria adams     sporty   melanie chisolm     scary   melanie brown     and baby   emma bunton         each one has their own personality and   perhaps the best part of the film   look like they are having some honest to goodness fun   something that can t be said for a lot of people in films today    along for the ride are richard e   grant as their manager   clifford   and various other characters making quick cameo appearances   including teriffic british actors like richard briers and stephen fry         and   every once and a while   roger moore pops up as the chief to spout odd koans   added bonus   he gets to   in the words of craig kilborn   dance   dance   dance      watching this film was fun   for the most part       there are a few slow segments   but overly   director bob spiers keeps things moving at a quick pace   with plenty of hummable spice girls songs in the background       his camerawork is fairly pedestrian   though the final concert number is done quite well with effective use of editing        the look of the film promotes the high fun   with the design of the spicebus being quite original and eye catching       add in wall to wall spice girls music and this film is lovable romp       if you don t like the spice girls   you won t change your mind with this film       but   if you find them at least tolerable   get ready to sit back and chill because the spice girls are here to entertain you            and do it quite well           spice world     1998         directed by bob spiers       written by kim fuller       music by the spice girls       with geri halliwell   victoria adams   melanie chisolm   melanie brown   emma bunton   richard e   grant   claire rushbrook   roger moore       distributed by columbia pictures       running time   92 minutes       rated   pg       available on home video         29 june 1998  

Pos, though it is a fine piece of filmmaking   there s something about elizabeth       that  left me a bit cold   and i think it is something that bugs me quite often in films   particularly these days   i just didn t care about the characters    to me   the first and foremost job of a filmmaker is to create characters   be they imagined or historical as the case may be   that the audience gives a hoot about    and though elizabeth works well on many levels   it falls short of excellence because of that very reason    elizabeth takes place in england in 1554   as queen mary   half sister of elizabeth and a monarch on the side of catholicism is dying    before she dies   though   she cannot bear to sign a document which would condemn her half sister to death because of her heretical protestant beliefs    as a result   amidst much anger within the council   elizabeth becomes the queen of england    the film chronicles her rise to power as she fights for a unified church of england and tries to bring order to her personal and political life    much of the film deals with elizabeth s love for lord robert   a mysterious man who thrusts his lordship onto many a woman as he continues to proclaim his love for the queen    there is much ado about her lack of a husband   and political pressures from spain and france enter into the equation    the problem with the film lies with this as its centerpiece   as love interests are such a character driven element    i didn t much care about the characters   perhaps aside for elizabeth who is played quite well by blanchett   and so i didn t have much interest in who would join her in her nuptials    the cast is rounded out well with the marvelous rush who plays the queen s most loyal advisor   sir francis   and attenborough as a well meaning but old fashioned lead council    why then   you must be asking   do i recommend elizabeth    simply because it is the result of a perfect pairing of director and cinematographer    kapur and his cinematographer remi adefarasin   neither of whom i have heard   create a beautifully realized piece of filmmkaing from the technical side    the light streams through each frame as in any painting from the period and beautifully captures the realistic light sources that would have been found in churches   cellars and castles in 16th century europe    each frame is rich with color contrasted with blackness or blown out white light from windows    the costumes by alexandra byrne deserve a mention as they are such an inportant aspect of each shot    indeed   elizabeth is one of the most visually beautiful films of the decade   ranking with kundun and braveheart    watch also for the incredibly   godfather esque   mass murder scene    it made me think in retrospect of the similarities between the two films    

Pos, america has finally gotten what it s needed for years   a compassionate sincere president with impressive ethics and charisma    regretfully it s only a movie    president james marshall   harrison ford   is fed up with terrorist activities    teaming up with the russian government   he orders a strike force capture of alexander radek   a reactionary general ready to re unite the soviet union under his fascist reign    during a celebration dinner   marshall announces to the world that he will send troops to fight oppression wherever it exists       it s your turn to be afraid     he declares    returning home on air force one   he gets the chance to demonstrate his words personally    ultra nationalist militants loyal to radek and lead by ivan korshunov   gary oldman   hijack the plane threatening to kill a hostage every half hour until the general is released    marshall has a chance to escape in a jettisoned capsule   which clinton says doesn t exist in real life   but refuses   preferring to stay and fight    director wolfgang peterson     das boot       in the line of fire       outbreak   takes the over used   die hard   theme and gives us something new in a film that combines brilliant acting with hold your breath intensity    if you can take your eyes off the screen   steal a look at the audience    everyone is totally engrossed    the two actors do what they do best and they are probably the best there are at it    oldman has become typecast as a psychotic sadist and no wonder    he does it so well    when he engages the teenage first daughter in sensitive conversation about his family and the next minute threatens to blow a hole in her forehead   you know that he s over the edge in the manner that people with a cause can become    you are convinced that young alice could end up terminated at any time    when korshonov executes passengers   there is a frightening reality to it    the guns in this film are deadly weapons   not cartoons    harrison ford has done one role for several years    his mastery of the man in the suit propelled into desperate action is in top form here    marshall is a medal of honor recipient who now has a desk job    realistically   he s a man afraid   but not afraid to act    ford is one of the few actors that could make us believe that the president of the united states could be an action hero    indiana jones in the oval office    he and oldman s archetypes match up perfectly    the other roles also go to accomplished actors    glenn close as the determined but unsure vice president is the picture of an executive forced into a position that she s not quite ready for    dean stockwell as defense secretary eager for the authority     i m in charge here !      is her political nemesis and turns in a good alexander haig performance    of course the politics are all wrong    a cowboy president   even down to his name   with big guns shoots his way through problems    much like the american collective memory of jfk s camelot   the image is wondrous if you don t look too deep    the pulls on the patriotic heartstrings would be too much in any other film   but they work here    no matter what political spin you put on the story   the movie is an outstanding one    i left the theater feeling that there is hope for the country s future   not a common belief nowadays    now if we only can get ford to run for president    just because one actor didn t work out as chief executive doesn t mean that a different one couldn t       michael redman has lost count of how many years he s been writing this column    21 years       22 years    while watching the sunflowers outside his window swaying in the cool breezes      

Pos, susan granger s review of   songcatcher   in the midst of this summer s fare of dinos revisited and romantic fiascoes   there are a few thoughtful movies   and this appalachian period drama is one    oscar nominee janet mcteer     tumbleweeds     stars as dr   lily penleric   an accomplished musicologist who   back in that pre feminist era   was refused a full professorship at her university    determined to prove her worth   she ventures deep into the rugged mountains of north carolina   where her younger sister elna   jane adams   runs a school    there in bear creek   she discovers a treasure trove of traditional scots irish and english folk ballads   given a unique interpretation by the insular locals    excited   she sends for recording equipment and persuades vinie butler   pat carroll   and other self sustaining mountain folk to share their musical heritage on her edison phonograph cylinders    their music   as she puts it   is   as much a part of life here as the air you breathe      that s the main thrust of writer director maggie greenwald s occasionally uneven culture clash story   which is loosely based on olive dame campbell s foray through the blue ridge mountains in 1908   but there s also some melodramatic romantic spice    ornery   bearded   banjo picking aidan quinn falls for the statuesque   passionate   songcatcher     while elna secretly engages in a lesbian relationship with a colleague   e    katherine kerr      i m ready to buy the soulful soundtrack with vocalists like emmylou harris   iris dement   taj mahal and young opera star emmy rossum who plays a pivotal role as mcteer s wide eyed prot   g      rated pg 13   there s an intense scene of primitive childbirth    on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10     songcatcher   is an intelligent   extraordinary 8   transported by the transcendent power of song    

Pos, titanic is   without a doubt   the best movie i ve seen all year    and believe me   i m not an easy critic to impress   the english patient was too long   men in black was over hyped   and several of the   big summer releases   were dead in the water    thank god this film got delayed until december    it s my christmas present    titanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of years gone by   and it is truly a stunning film    while watching this picture you are completely mesmerized   never taking your eyes off the screen   nor checking your watch to see how much longer it s gonna last   despite its 3 hour plus running time    as a friend of mine   who s a true titanic buff   said   if someone doesn t like this film   it s because they didn t want to      truer words are hard to come by    of course   it doesn t hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors   james cameron   who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time    if you wish to argue that point with me   look at his list of credits   the terminator   aliens   the abyss   terminator 2   true lies   etc   still care to disagree    not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film   he also wrote   produced   and edited it    and to show his true faith for the project   he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs    it s obvious he truly loves titanic    the film opens with footage   both real and fake   of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic   where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the   heart of the ocean     which   according to bill paxton s character   would be worth more than the hope diamond today    their search turns up   dissapointly   no diamond   but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond    this picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose   who claims to be the girl in the picture    she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond    almost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past    rose s narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl   engaged to a rich man named cal hockley   billy zane   that she didn t want to marry    her mother is pushy and obnoxious   and cal hockley is arrogant    they are boarding the titanic   which is sailing to america   and this is where she is to marry cal    meanwhile   a young man named jack dawson   leonardo dicaprio   and his italian friend   danny nucci   win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game    they are overjoyed   and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving    for them   this is their ticket to america   to a better life    for rose   she is sailing to her doom    the first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt   kate winslet   and jack dawson fall in love    it s the classic wrong side of the tracks story   and does sometimes resort to a few cliches    but as i said above   the love portion isn t sappy and doesn t   weigh the film down     as some critics have said    it s sweet   and it didn t make me restless at all   despite the fact that i usually hate love stories    of course   it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen    most of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912   including the enigmatic molly brown   played by the talented kathy bates     the captain of titanic   bernard hill     and so on    all of these characters add an extra depth to the film   and make it that easier to watch    of course   things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark   where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom    the sinking is depicted realisticly   and the effects are truly amazing    it is not told in a heroic fashion sense either   as people are portrayed as panicking   pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats   and drowning and dying horrible deaths    the best part of the movie   in my opinion   comes at the very end   when we flash back to the future    the crew   who at first had been skeptical of rose s story   now are totally aborbed by her    rose goes out onto the ship s ledge   and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard    we then see a dream of rose s   in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson    most people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream    however   i think it symbolized more   i think it meant that rose had died   and is going to a sort of heaven   which would be the happiest part of her life   her and her one true love   jack    if anyone has seen the movie and would like to voice an opinion about this   e mail me at venom8@hotmail   com    

Pos, sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film    sometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride    i saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers   most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes    surprised   they may have been   when they realized that this picture actually had something to say    but by the attentiveness of the crowd i d say they were won over   as was i   i can t tell yet if truman really is that good   or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year    time alone will make that call    but by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank s side    we were concerned for his well being   and wanted him to win    that we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey   who has achieved legitimacy at last    the truman show is a film best viewed cold   with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot    unless you re under a media blackout   however   you probably know the basics    carrey stars as truman burbank   a capra esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl   laura linney   in the south florida island town of seahaven   which looks like michael eisner s idea of the perfect american small town    truman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle   complete with a working wife   a best bud   friendly neighbors and interesting co workers    there is tragedy in his past   his father drowned in a horrible boating accident   leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water   and of travel in general   but overall   life is good    but then one day as truman leaves his house for work   a klieg light falls magically from the sky    this curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows   that he is a prisoner on the world s biggest soundstage   that his wife   friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him   and that his life has   for over 10   000 days   been broadcast as the world s most popular television program    what makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir    the soundstage   we re told   is   only the second man made structure visible from space      truman s movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5   000 cameras scattered throughout the town   button cams   dashboard cams   mirror cams   wife cams   big cams and small cams    weir cuts the film so we re never quite sure if we re watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the show s omnipotent creator christof   ed harris   who oversees the show from a control room built into the man made moon in seahaven s sky    the second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence    his best friend marlon   noah emmerich   always has a six pack of beer with him    his wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product    he sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town    one wonders why he didn t pick up on any of this earlier   but christof has an answer for this     people tend to accept the reality with which they re presented      nevertheless   truman begins to grow restless   and dreams of escape to fiji   where an old college sweetheart   natasha mcelhone   supposedly lives    this convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical and provocative concept   the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way    by underplaying truman   he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to take over    there is a particularly poignant scene in which truman confides his fears to marlon   and marlon answers with best friend sincerity     i d gladly step in front of a bus for you      but that line was fed to marlon through an earpiece by christof    the abject cruelty to which truman is subjected to hits home   and from that moment   we re on his side    the truman show derives much of its success from playing to our own secret paranoid fantasies   haven t we all   at least once   doubted our place in the world   doubted the sincerity of those closest to us    ultimately   however   the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator    what does god really think of us    does he resent our abandonment of paradise    who exactly is watching us   up there in the sky    if you enjoy the picture as much as i did   credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay to work    as for carrey   well   truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play    carrey is no jimmy stewart   to his credit   he doesn t try to be    he just tries to feel the way you or i would   if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us    

Pos, there s a moment in schindler s list when a number of jews are trudging through snow   clean and crisp   dark edges and frost on the ground    one girl waltzes through   wearing a red dress that stings the eyes    it is probably the finest moment through out the film    when i first saw it i began to cry   though i could not say why    this landscape is the setting of many small moments that add up to one big whole    when one man is shot in the head we see blood oozing out onto the ground    so black and murky   its almost pomegranate red    at another time we follow a young boy as he runs   searching for a hiding spot before finally squeezing into a toilet    which is already occupied    like so   citizen kane   fargo   the godfather   the godfather part ii   greed     many of the greatest american films   schindler s list plays with the concepts of money   power   and soul    but this is a movie about a man who does the right thing    starkly emotional   and brutally powerful   schindler s list strips away everything on the outset and leaves us ony feelings    the following that it has gained is not suprising    this is probably   thus far   the best film of the decade    steven spielberg has always been a skilfull filmmaker    his assured hand churned out both jurassic parks   jaws   the indiana jones films   and e   t       but it wasn t until 1993 that we saw what a brilliant man he can be    the product of his genuis is really something to see    it can bring tears to your eyes just as it uplifts you    throughout   we sense the deep control which he so masterfully spreads    we watch oskar schindler   liam neeson   grow from an arrogant   self important man who hires jews only to save money into a moving figure   with a deep sense of pride and accomplishment    the film requires much work   and can be a harrowing experience    go expecting a quick entertainment and you ll be bitterly dissapointed    it does reward the patient viewer    this is a mature spielberg   and his deft hands shape an absoloute masterpiece    this eqsuisite   beautiful film is a rare gem    it does a good job of summarizing why i love movies    it leaves one breathless   uplifted   and with much to think about    afterwards you can reflect on individual images   visions   and people    laconic   removed   schindler strides through the film a detached prescence who watches all   does much   and leaves feeling as if he could   should   have done more then he did and was able to    the change seems natural    in the hands of a lesser filmmaker   it would be crude and would cheat the audience    instead we are told a tale   told a story    the film is punishing to watch   yes    but anyone who allows themselves to get involved will experience a miracle   and a genuine masterpiece of a movie    

Pos, full metal jacket   very much like every other hard hitting film about the vietnam war   is an shocking   emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america    this film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man   private joker   played by matthew modine   during his tour in the vietnam war    however   full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before   boot camp    these sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film   even though i found the later portions to be equally stunning    as in platoon   full metal jacket gets off to a quick start    the opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits   which is getting their heads shaved    from there   they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman   played extremely well by the former drill instructor r   lee ermey    apparently   the solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructor in the movies   because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations    private joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant   as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence   vincent d onofrio     whom is dubbed  gomer pyle  by sgt    hartman    the film is continually narrated by private joker   in which he explains his visions on what is going on    the entire corps   although repeatedly hammered by sgt    hartman   continues on    private pyle   however   seems to be the rag doll for the drill instructor    he continually absorbs the worst punishment and humiliation   and it basically does not stop    that is   until sgt    hartman comes up with a new plan    he will punish the rest of the soon to be marines for pyle s goof ups   even after joker was assigned to help him out in the best way he can    pyle then receives punishment from his fellow recruits   and things take a turn for the worst    pyle proves that not everyone is emotionally   physically   and mentally cut out for the life of a marine    after graduation   joker is sent over to the height of the action in order to document the war   which is his service    he is not a member of the infantry   and it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself in combat    when he sets out on a documenting mission   this question becomes very clear from the start    joker joins up with a platoon   along with his hometown friend cowboy   arliss howard     and follows their everyday actions   interviewing and filmming them along the way    he also soon finds himself in a position in which he must fight   or die    again   as in the tradition of vietnam war films   full metal jacket can be debated as to whether it is an anti war film or not    a few of the more powerful scenes toward the end will leave you to decide    full metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting the life of a young man in vietnam   as have others in the past    this film   in different ways   also can be viewed as more powerful than others    that   again   is up for debate and depends on your opinion    one thing is for sure   however   no one ever wants to experience the absolute hell that these soldiers are subjected to    unfortunately   many did    

Pos, pulp fiction   quentin tarantino s anxiously awaited and superb follow up to reservoir dogs   is absolutely and without a doubt progressing as one of the most talked about   loved   and hated films of all time    in all fairness   it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it    as if reservoir dogs wasn t perfect   tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction   a fast paced   hard talking   roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way    every major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor    to begin with   the two hit men   vincent vega   john travolta   and jules winnfield   samuel l   jackson      these two characters work together perfectly   and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect    travolta   in fact   is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role    if these two characters were not enough   there s the struggling boxer butch coolidge   bruce willis     the two small time criminals pumpkin   tim roth   and honey bunny   amanda plummer     the big man in charge marsellus wallace   ving rhames   and his attractive young wife mia   uma thurman     and the   problem solver   himself   the wolf   harvey keitel      these are just the major characters    smaller roles   but equally terrific   are handed to jimmie   quentin tarantino     a young married man who gets caught up in some serious gangster business   lance   eric stoltz     the far out drug dealer   as well as maynard   duane whitaker   and zed   peter greene     two hillbillies who are the men   behind     no pun intended for those of you who have seen this   a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film    the film interweaves three stories that   at first   seem to be nothing alike but later prove to be very critical to each other    the film begins with pumpkin and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and hold ups    the two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop   unknowing of what lies ahead    after this   the film focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle    utilizing the films unforgettable dialogue   the two men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants    the two men were sent to the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase for their boss   marsellus wallace    after basically toying with the men   especially the unfortunate brett   frank whaley     vincent and jules complete their mission and recover the briefcase    this is not before a man jumps out from a bathroom with a   357     hand cannon     shooting at the two gangsters    he somehow completely misses them   leading jules to cite divine intervention    this is also the basis for more of the now famous tarantino dialogue    the film then shifts to focus on boxer butch coolidge and his boxing escapades    butch was ordered to take a fall in his latest fight   but when he does not   marsellus vows to find him   wherever he is   and make sure that butch is not able to enjoy his new fortune    vincent   meanwhile   has the honor of taking marsellus  wife   mia   out on a date while the big man is out of town    vincent   obviously   is rather nervous about this   especially after hearing the tale about a man who was thrown out of a window for supposedly giving mia a foot massage    after their date   which seems to rather smoothly   things take a turn for the worst at the hands of vincent s high priced heroin   dubbed a   monster   by lance    each story continually progresses   and new and amazing events occur    eventually   the stories all meet each other in the end   with pumpkin and honey bunny holding up the restaurant   which happens to contain both vincent and jules    pulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade   and possibly of all time    along with its superb dialogue   action   writing   directing   and acting   this film will not only latch onto you   but it proves that it does not want to release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you    and with most fans of this movie   this is proved to be a rather easy task   although at times the graphic images   violence   and language may seem a bit overpowering    surely   quentin tarantino s fame was greatly escalated by this film   and he proves not to be one who will fade from existence very soon    

Pos, in 1998   director brett ratner and his stars   jackie chan and chris tucker   breathed new life into the buddy action film genre with the cross cultural   rush hour     to the tune of about $250 million    you don t mess with success   so the team is back again   and better   in   rush hour 2      the combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the non stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in   rush hour   that played well to audiences around the world    the formula worked so well   in fact   that the sequel was inevitable    i m never thrilled with the idea of a follow up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations    surprisingly     rush hour 2   wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it    the script   by jeff nathanson   utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film     wastes no time getting to the point right from the start    terrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong   killing two american translators   and chief inspector lee   jackie chan   is handed the job of solving the crime    concurrently   his friend james carter   chris tucker   arrives on the island for some much needed r&r and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights    instead   lee drags carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars    the makers of   rush hour 2   are working at a distinct advantage over the original    we   the viewer   are familiar with the two lead characters and the already existing chemistry that chan and tucker developed so well the first time around    that chemistry was a high point   and probably the saving point   before and   now   the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable suit    little time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in   rush hour      first and foremost to me   in   rh2     is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chan s artistry in fight choreography    the 47 year old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and   here   he does not disappoint    chan s use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand   such as a trash bucket    his moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding   on the tail end of a yacht   in a hong kong massage parlor and   for the finale   in a las vegas casino    like harold lloyd or buster keaton   chan takes pride in putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a joy to watch    chris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop   carter   who teams   again   with lee to put down the bad guys    when he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleague and friend with the big case   he still looks to have some fun    when lee goes into a karaoke bar   the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan   john lone   and his hoods   carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff    the comedian made the move from the improv stage to the big screen and   with jackie chan   has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills    the combo of chan s flying feet and fists with tucker s fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs and murtaugh in the   lethal weapon   films    the supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently    john lone   as ricky tan   is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign   alan king in a walk through performance      lone doesn t chew scenery or make pronouncements to   get lee and carter     but gives the chief bad guy elegance    zhang zi yi     crouching tiger   hidden dragon     continues to display her martial arts skills as ricky s taciturn henchlady   hu li   who carries on an ongoing battle with carter       carter has a problem   through most of the film   with hitting a woman   but this falls aside with their eventual one on one melee at the conclusion      roselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous   and resembles sandra bullock   as undercover agent isabella molina   she doesn t add much to the equation but is terrific to watch    director ratner and the original   rush hour   production team have assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen to work behind the camera    cinematographer matthew f   leonetti has had a long career of shooting action flicks and gives   rh2   the fluid camera movement the genre film needs    production design by terrence marsh spans continents and gives the right look   whether it is in a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino    the rest of the techs are of the same high quality    i m surprised to even say that   rush hour 2   is the most entertaining of the summer blockbuster movies    it takes the best of the first film and kicks jurassic dino butt in its fun   frolic and fast pace and is the best mainstream thing out   so far   this summer    i give it a b    

Pos, my fellow americans is a movie that at first glance looks to have little substance   or a movie that we ve all seen a million times     two lifetime rivals thrown together and then the fun begins    this is exactly what happened in this movie   but fortunately   they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way    the movie starts with a quick   and i do mean quick   glance of two presidents russell kramer   jack lemmon   and matt douglas   james garner      william haney   dan aykroyd   and ted matthews   john heard   are the new president and vice president    there is a scandal that arises involving a kickback from a contractor and haney is positive that he buried that years ago    he finds a scapegoat in kramer and now everyone wants kramer and douglas dead    this movie was exceptional for many reasons    one being that they found people   lemmon and garner   that have good chemisty together    they worked very well as a unit and they mirrored each other perfectly   one being a ladies man and one being the old man   i ll let you fiqure which is which      also   they found people that know their parts as govenment officials well    it seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman   except then he was a congressman      experience counts for a lot ! !  

Pos, frequency n      the number of times a specified phenomenon occurs within a specified interval as the number of repetitions of a complete sequence of values of a periodic function per unit variation of an independent variable   etc  don t worry    when watching the thriller frequency   you won t have to know what the heck frequency means    the premise   although it may sound complex   is very basic on the big screen    a new york cop   john     jim caviezel   finds a radio in his house   which allows him to communicate with his new york firefighter father   frank     dennis quaid   who died thirty years ago    immediately john warns his father that he will die trying to stop a fire in an abandoned warehouse    when frank takes his advice and survives the accident he wasn t supposed to   the two eventually realize that by changing that one moment in the past   they have created a whole new future in which a serial killer murders john s mother and nine other women    it is now up to john and frank to use their special connection and save thirty years ago to make present time a better place       i told you that wasn t confusing        overall   i was very pleased with frequency    it s occasional sappy moments perfectly synchronized with its suspenseful serial killer scenes    i usually don t buy those cheesy   i love you dad   segments in movies   but this one surprisingly satisfied me    maybe because the plot is so creative and universal that i believed that this is how most people would act when talking to a dead relative    frequency s creepy premise left me thinking once the film ended   what if    what would i do    would i help my own family or save a historical figure from being assasinated    or stop some kids from shooting other kids    or buy stock from yahoo !       a character in the film does the latter with humorous consequences      frequency also reminded me of the fantastic back to the future    both share that   change the past slightly   and you ll change the future heavily   warning    the changes between the present and the past   such as different newspaper headlines or people disappearing and reappearing in photographs   are very similar    both are also wonderful feel good family films that can attract to a number of generations    the only difference worth noting is that frequency s final scene doesn t set up a possibility for a lucrative sequel already in the making    there are some problems with the film though    first   there is a major flaw in the story towards the end that is somewhat distracting   email me if you have seen the movie and want to know what i think it is      the plot must have confused even the filmmakers who frequently   no pun intended   switch from 1969 to 1999 while telling the story    another problem is that the supporting cast   including noah emmerich and andre braugher   are underused    while in the film   which is not enough   the aforementioned actors steal every scene they are in    frequency was a pleasant surprise for me and the audience i saw it with who cheered at the end    even if you know what is going to happen or if you think the preview ruined the movie for you   like it almost did for me   check this movie out    you may be surprised as well    

Pos, ladies and gentlemen   1997 s independence day is here !  it s title   starship troopers    and surprisingly   it is more entertaining than id4    i realize that i gave last year s sci fi hit a 4 star rating   but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour    after subsequent viewings   i feel that independence day really wasn t as great as it seemed  though i still give it a positive review    starship troopers   on the other hand   has a mocking sense of humor   knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem    as a result   starship troopers is a more exciting   energetic   and lively science fiction film    in fact   i probably could never get tired of watching this film    starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars   another kick ass space opera which reinvented the sci fi drama altogether    while starship troopers is no star wars   it comes quite close   and the easiest assessment would be to call this film     the  star wars  of the 90s      am i being to generous to this film    perhaps   but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance   effectively   into the warring races    in essence   this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction    the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films   and i may have to    starship troopers is not quite an original film persay   but director paul verhoeven gives the film a   kick the aliens  asses   style    id4 had this same style   except it was forced   most likely the cause of will smith having a major role    this new   star wars   has a very simple   basic plot   mankind vs   an alien species    the alien species in question here is the bugs   a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid type insects    however   the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy    sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes   but during quiet moments   we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization    more than likely   these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends    and they should be    i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought provoking film    this is an   event   film   but surprisingly above average    it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci fi war film   and actually root for the human side   something independence day never achieved      starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange   join the army   ads    mixing a web based interface   these summations of events are refreshingly original    stating     would you like to know more        these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor   and we know we should not take it seriously    however   we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle   in a gory   yet funny   way    after witnessing the slaughter   the film jumps back one year   to setup what we just saw    we are introduced to johnny rico   casper van dien   and carmen ibanez   denise richards      rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms    however   carmen isn t as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot    however   another classmate   dizzy flores   dina meyer     has her eye on rico    unfortunately   rico isn t interested in dizzy    this setup is rather cliched   as is the result of the setup   but it still is fun to watch    carmen signs up to become a starship trooper   and as a result   rico signs up    and as a result   dizzy signs up    everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy   carmen gets the pilot position she wanted   carl jenkins   neil patrick harris     a psychic   gets a position in the training program   and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers   the mobile infantry    the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships    in reality   i found myself watching a space version of   melrose place     but with better special effects    an hour into the film   the war begins    a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with    the first hour may have been a funny   sometimes unintentionally   setup   but we grew to care for the flat characters   because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters   their gorgeous looks won me over   call me superficial   if you must      following the training sessions   which had many dramas in themselves   too many to mention here     the troopers are sent to war    the bugs live on the planet klendathu   a planet which consists of dirt and rock   and pretty much nothing else    many dramas occur during the war   until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs  attacks    a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense    the troopers are ordered to locate the   brain   and capture it    i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible   because starship troopers is not about plot    it s about special effects and gory violence    director verhoeven   most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct   returns to his sci fi days   which gave us good films like total recall    verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa   but despite all the violence   the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood    starship troopers is extremely violent   with more gore than this year s event horizon    the r rating is well deserved   and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it    my guess is that verhoeven s target audience is the 18 to 25 male group    the film has a testosterone level off the charts   with chiseled men and beautiful women    despite these superficial elements   starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful    while watching the film   we never second guess the character s decisions because they seem perfectly clear    thankfully   no hero is punching aliens in the face   which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with    the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with   but they soon grow on you    casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon    to most guys   he will come across as artificial    fortunately   van dien is the worst of the cast   despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character    dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character    her dizzy is extremely likeable    denise richards also does a good job   and her scenes are very well done    jake busey   gary busey s son   gives a wonderfully funny performance   and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film    neil patrick harris   remember   he was doogie howser   is a little wooden   and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast    however   he does give a good performance    michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm    his performance rises above the rest    perhaps it is because his character is the most developed   but i think it is just ironside s presence on screen    unfortunately   no particular cast member gives a star making performance   which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars    director verhoeven is the main star of the film    his direction is fast and unrelentless    he never slows down his pace   which makes for a wild ride    writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein    the writing is usually very funny   and sometimes very corny    the dialogue is smart but not too smart    we aren t required to know everything   but some plot holes are left unanswered    thankfully we are not intended to notice   and we really don t   except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while      amazingly   with all the wars and romance going on   the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues    in fact   these governmental changes seem fairly plausible   and this adds another layer to the story    the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre   but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage    i haven t laughed this loud   even in some comedies    oh   and the special effects are first rate    starship troopers is rated r for graphic sci fi violence and gore   and for some language and nudity    believe me when i say this   don t take young kids to see this film    it is extremely violent    in fact   it is probably the most violent film out this year    however   if you are old enough   over 17   to see it   starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain    it s been a long time since i have cheered for the heros   while also cheering for the bad guys    and still   it is my dream to see a sci fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind   and take over the world    now that would be entertaining !  

Pos, synopsis   an attractive mute makeup artist   working on an ultra cheesy slasher movie in moscow   witnesses the production of a brutal snuff film and is subsequently chased by really bad russians    meanwhile   the artist s sister and boyfriend clumsily try to save her    comments   mute witness came as a surprise to me the first time i watched it    drawn by the clever artwork on the video box   i rented the film expecting a complete turkey    mute witness   however   was original   offbeat   and well made    it s one of those cool little finds that no one seems to know about    i ve subsequently found it at most video rental places i visit   and it may be seen   on occasion   on the independent film channel    the first hour of mute witness is extremely tense   as billy   the quite believable mute heroine   sees members of the russian mob brutally kill a prostitute while filming an illegal snuff film    the rest of the film takes good advantage of billy s vulnerable position as a mute foreigner in moscow being pursued by powerful criminal figures    to throw a curveball into the fray   billy s sister karen and her filmmaking beau become bizarre figures of comic relief to offset several violent sequences in what are some genuinely funny scenes    a disappointingly trite ending and occasional comic blunders are the only two things which mar this otherwise suspenseful film    look for alec guinness   obi wan kenobi from the first star wars trilogy   in a small role as the evil reaper    definately check this movie out   although   as a word of warning   it does contain several scenes of rather grisly violence which certainly aren t for the squeamish    

Pos, i was pleasantly surprised by this film    with a budget topping $200 million   i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century s greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see    how much could you dress up the sets    how many models and computer effects could you use    how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks    oh   if i ve just given away part of the plot for you   go back to school    after having viewed titanic   however   i found it to be a well paced   well designed   and overall well made movie    there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic   but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i ve seen    titanic tells its story in two time periods    it starts out in the present   when ocean explorer brock lovett   bill paxton   and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic   searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship    what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace   which is broadcast on the news    the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett   who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas    there she tells her story to lovett and his team    in 1912   rose dewitt bukater   kate winslett     a young lady belonging to society s upper class   boards the titanic for the ship s first atlantic crossing   from southampton   england to new york    she is engaged to cal hockley   billy zane     an heir to old money   and a snob in every sense of the word    on board   rose feels the stifling trappings of high society s expectations   and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic s stern   but is saved from her self proclaimed fate by jack dawson   leonardo dicaprio     a passenger in third class     steerage     as it s referred to     who talks her out of jumping    although for rose the attraction is not immediate   a love affair soon develops between the two   which endangers rose s social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal    the story sounds very simple   and perhaps even unexciting   but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron   a good movie comes through    dicaprio is marvelous as the young   but worldly wise jack   playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors    his is a character that is immediately likable   as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations    girls are going to swoon over him    winslet also proves herself a good actress   delivering her lines convincingly   and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable    the only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character s upbringing    simply by judgment of her gait   i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper crust debutante    rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess   she sometimes looks positively clumsy   and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting    billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal   since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him    his features are such that even when he smiles   there s something mistrustful about him   and when he scowls   he is evil incarnate    he s something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher   but a cheaper model    like dicaprio and winslet   zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well    backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy   cal s personal assistant   or   man   as they said at the turn of the century      no matter who else is in the cast   you can always count on a good performance by warner   who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match    additionally   there are a number of smaller fictional and non fictional roles thrown in for color   such as kathy bates as   the unsinkable   molly brown   danny nucci as jack s friend fabrizio de rossi   eric braeden as john jacob astor   and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie    nice to see dr   bombay getting work    also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die    this by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic   but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ship s crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the first class passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else    in this way   titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures    you don t just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop   but a very real account of class struggle as well    as i mentioned before   the budget for this film was tremendous   and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects    the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail   and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic    with regard to the exteriors   i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale    cameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank   but only had room for 90%   and therefore had to computer generate the remaining 40 feet    could ve fooled me and everyone else in the theater   as the splicing is seamless    also of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning    we are told of where the iceberg struck the ship   how the flooding occurred   the way the ship sank   and why it did so in that manner    these technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening   and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction   in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion    in all   james cameron s titanic is a good blend of love story   history   and action    the fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer s attention is held alternately by those three main elements   from the movie s intriguing beginning to it s satisfactory ending    in box office receipts   titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship    

Pos, it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system    no major surprise   when j   s   mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either    the americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which they exist   the supreme contradiction between the right of the one and the right of the majority    small wonder that hollywood s most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individual underdog against some larger collective oppressive   witness braveheart   born on the fourth of july   rocky   first blood   clear and present danger   jfk   the list goes on    there s little of that in singapore   we are barred access to playboy and penthouse both on and off line   though the government s been long worried about the younger people getting   americanised   and advocating individual rights and parliamentary opposition    the people vs   larry flynt locates the political debate within the greatest social taboo in america   sex    does pornography have a right to exist and circulate    larry flynt   the publisher of hustler magazine   thinks so   and obviously so too the u   s   congress which last month threw out a bill to curb pornography on the net    but even with such actions   americans remain undecided    the oscars apparently shunned the movie because it was an embarrassing and sensitive livewire    what they have ignored is actually a great picture    woody harrelson as the lead character reprises his role as a to hell with morality   to hell with the law   and to hell with the system anti christ that we last saw in natural born killers    and he is outrageous and convincing as a nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his ex stripper wife dearly    the latter is played with abandon   conviction and sensitivity all at once by courtney love   who is the real star of the show and really snubbed of an academy award best actress nomination   if not of the award itself    edward norton plays their jerky lawyer    the relationship between harrelson and love brings out another great paradox   superficially they are immoral outcasts who ve had it coming   woody gets shot and becomes paralysed from the waist down   and courtney dies of aids    god s damnation    but in the powerful love they have for each other   each standing by the other in turn   the two leads highlight the question how much is the nihilist still a moralist and   in the american context   a christian   if they can love and care   and feel just like anyone else on a personal level    friedrich nietzsche once talked about how the atheist must uncover for himself the full consequences of atheism by ridding himself of all moral christian influences    to go beyond good and evil    this is a great picture   no doubt   and i love it personally    because it is moving   funny   ends with open american optimism blah blah    but i like it and admire it because it comes from a fine american tradition that dares to raise difficult questions   and call into doubt ideas and doctrines that otherwise are used as catchphrases    there are times when movies go beyond the story they tell and reflect something of hidden realities    this movie is not so much about larry flynt   but about americans and american society    

Pos, this has some major spoilers for the film   so be forwarned    the won t appear till later in the article   so you re safe for now    eyes wide shot   1999   running time   2 hours 39 minutes 2   35   1 theatrical aspect  starring   tom cruise   dr    bill hardford     nicole kidman   alice hardford     sidney pollack   leelee sobieski   todd field   nick nightingale   directed   co written   produced by   stanley kubrick inspired by     traumnovelle   by   arthur schnitzer  this is an interesting film    i must first off state   that you musn t believe any of the rumors of the film    cruise is not a cross dresser   kidman doesn t shoot heroin   and there s not any scene between the two that would suggest that they were aided by a sex therapist    the look of the film is to suggest that it follows the translation of the inspired book from the film was written    the translation     dream novel     makes you thing that the film should have been titled dream film    there is a noticable amount of graininess to the film    rather than complain about it as some may and already have   see it as a style of shooting    i would gather that kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting this and shot with as much natural light as he could    this and the film looks like it was pushed another two stops to add more grain and brighten it slightly    as an auteur and stickler for details   kubrick seemed to be a bit lax on this one    the film looks great   but there are a good deal of bloopers/flubs that occur    you see lots of boom shots   in reflection   and you see the camera at least twice    16 months for this    wow    reflection is the biggest killer for this film    their apartment and almost everything in the film casts reflections and the crew can be seen in these   some quite glaringly    one more topic of heated discussion   i saw the   austin powers   version   and to be perfectly frank   unless you know where the overlays are supposed to be   you ll probably not see them    two girls standing next to each other look a little suspicious   but i can wait for the unrated version on video to see it the way it s supposed to be    spoilers below    the film itself starts with   cruise   bill and   kidman   alice getting ready for a little x mas soiree    they go to a quite elegant party in what seems to be a storagehouse for lighting equipment   which is actually an apartment owned by pollack    bill runs into an old friend from medical school who is now the party s entertainment    soon after   bill and alice are flirting with others at the party   thinking that the other has not noticed    bill is called to help with a partygoer who has had a bit too much of a good time    the next day   bill and alice   casually smoking marijunana in their bedroom discuss the previous nights flirtations    they both discover that they both knew about the flirting    bill starts talking about what women can provide in a relationship   and gets alice extremely angry    in her hazy state   she tells of an opportunity she almost acted on to cheat on bill   not caring about the possible aftereffects    bill gets called away when one of his patients dies   and goes to console his daughter    when his patient s engaged daughter makes a plea for his love and affection   he is struck with images of an affair that never occured between his wife   alice and a naval officer    he sees   opportunity   as a betrayal to his wife   and before they can continue   they are interrupted    as he strolls home   he encounters a hooker    seeing another   opportunity   arise   he follows the hooker home    they toy around   but before the act ensues   alice calls his cell phone    he breaks the date with the hooker   and heads back out into the night    he passes a lounge and notices that his old medical school buddy is playing   so he heads in    when he meets the friend   the friend reveals that for extra scratch   he plays these strange parties   while blindfolded    bill is intrigued and wants to go to one    nick reluctantly sets him up with directions and a password    what follows this is a short meeting where bill obtains a costume for this party and meets a young girl   leelee sobieski   and her father    the young girl has drawn his eye   but her young age   and the prescence of her father deter this from happening    he gets to the party   which is to say the least   a strange affair    after partaking in some strange   religious   right   women and men pair off for the orgy to end all orgies    a woman warns bill in disguise   that he should leave before he is exposed as a fraud at the party    he is detained after a second warning   where he is outed for not being in the group    after getting home   he hides the evidence of his evenings events    unable to carry on in his day   he tries piece the events of the previous night together    in the process   he finds that nick has disappeared   his life is possibly in danger   and the woman that warned him has died    i m trying to save a bit of the film here   it s worth sitting through to get to this point    this is only about 100 minutes at this point    this is a strange film   because despite the events that occur   the film has a strong family message behind it    it will be hard to pidgeonhole this film as a certain kind of a film    it s got sex in it   it has nudity   drugs   and many more immoralistic values    but they all serve to show why they are bad in one s life    i recommend this film highly on many merits    cruise and kidman are rarely together for longer than 5 minutes after the opening scene   and the secrecy that shrouded the film should hopefully be apparent as to why it was kept once you see it for yourself    

Pos, barely scrapping by playing at a nyc piano bar   timothy hutton returns to his massachusetts hometown for a couple of weeks    on the surface   he s coming home for a high school reunion   but since this is a movie   you know that he s really looking for some major life decisions    a fairly   small   film   this sports an impressive ensemble cast including uma thurman   rosie o donnell and a bunch of actors that you ve seen before but can t quite place    commendable jobs all around   they seem like real people    hutton arrives at his past and is greeted by his spirit dead father   terminally goony brother and old high school chums    all of his old buddies are engaged in the snow removal business and most are in the midst of a relationship crisis    the perfect stuff for a comedy about people in the twenties angst    he meets and falls for the new next door neighbor   a beautiful intelligent lively girl who is obviously taken with him    the problem is that she is only 13    unconsummated   no   it s not  that  type of movie     their relationship builds and neither knows what to do with it    star crossed lovers with no where to go    so hutton is gaga over a barely teen   one of his buddies is two timing his girlfriend with a married old flame   another s girlfriend is sleeping with a meat cutter     and she s a vegetarian !        things are a mess    enter uma thurman    the beautiful stranger in town for a few days is both a delight in the film and one of its minor downfalls    her character is fun to watch    even more entertaining is observing the guys falling over themselves trying to impress her    like the lone ranger   before she leaves   she solves most of the problems and sets everyone onward with their lives    the ending is a bit too pat    everything is tied up with a neat little bow    rosie o donnell is a stand out in her limited screen time with her brash personality and   tell it like it is   pronouncements    structured somewhat like a   diner   a few years later     this feel good story is a good time   but ends a little too nice    

Pos, there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have   but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason       good will hunting   is about one of those people    the will hunting of the   horrible   title   let s face it   this film would be a bitch to title     played by co writer matt damon   is a mathematical genius    he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino    and he works at mit       as the janitor    one day   the professor of one of the most challenging courses   proffessor lambeau     breaking the waves    s stellan skarsg   rd     puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete    the next day   it s already done on the board   but no one in his class claims to have done it    so lambeau puts another problem on the board   this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove    and   duh   it s done again    of course   they catch the guy who did it red handed   will    before lambeau can find will again   he ran away when he caught him     will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court   and struck a police officer   so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements   a   he work with him on math   and b   he get some therapy    after going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another   for a hypnotist   he fakes being under his spell   then launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic     afternoon delight        finally   lambeau s old college roomate   sean mcguire   robin williams     a psych professor   agrees to treat him   and the two begin a rocky relationship   as sean tries to get will to open up    turns out will had a rough childhood   being abandoned   and placed in foster homes and what not    it also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life   he wants a challenge    and that is to hang out with his buds   including the other co writer   ben affleck     and do honorable jobs   like construction    is it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky    should this guy be forced to do something he doesn t want to do    this appears to be one of the million questions in this film   which is jam packed with greatness   but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should    i m not saying   good will hunting   is a bad film at all    it s a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments   and lots of great things about it    the acting is amazing   with two oscar nomination worthy performances from damon and williams   who have amazing chemistry together    we also get some great support from stellan skarsg   rd   great name     ben affleck   and from minnie driver   who plays will s love interest   skylar    there are tons of individual moments that i adored    i loved all the comedy in the film   especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks   his various attempts at therapy   and of course   my favorite scene in the entire film   the one where he delivers a long   exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them    i liked the relationship between some of the people   like will and skylar   will and sean   sean and lambeau   and will and his friends    there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch    and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal   that i felt rightfully uncomfortable    like the break up scene between will and skylar   will and sean s first meeting   a bar scene between sean and lambeau   and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn t regret meeting his first wife   who would later suffer a slow   painful death   and leave him lonely and slightly bitter    however   the main flaw of the film is there s too much of everything   and not enough of it either    the film tries for deeper relations between the characters   but they re sometimes either overwritten or underwritten    take for example the relationship between sean and will   the film gets an interesting father/son as well as doctor/patient relationship going with out any problems   but when it tries to show them as equals   it falls on its face    we hear how they went to the same town   and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times    but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do    also   will s relationship with his best friend   chuckie   affleck     has a nice climax   but not enough rising action    we see them joking around   but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them   it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one    their relationship never goes beyond   just best friends     and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more       human    maybe it was just me    and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau   but that   again   is underwritten    and   of course   as in most films like this   the girl/boy relationship is pretty underwritten    we never understand what they see in each other   so when skylar confesses that she loves him   it seems more like it s there for plot details that anything else    minnie driver is interesting   though   and breathes life into her character    the writing is a bit at fault here   but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness    sure   it feels overstuffed   but it s extremely enjoyable    the dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh   and seems extremely human    i think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue   which is amazing    while this is probably director gus van sant s most conservative film   you d hardly know it s the same director of   to die for     the only van sant film i ve seen   really     it s still a pretty remarkable film   albeit a tad overrated   what s this   best picture   deal        and if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws   i have no problem with reccomending it to anyone    

Pos, i m an avid fan of the   alien   saga   so this review is obviously a tad biased   at least i admitted it      of course   that doesn t mean that i m gonna be giving this a four star review or something   because   alien   resurrection     the fourth film in the cool as hell series is not an absolutely amazing film   much like the first two were    however   it s a very good film which never fails to entertain   and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series    in short   i had a good time       alien   resurrection   leaves off 200 years after the last one   where our heroine protagonist   ellen ripley   sigourney weaver     the science fiction genre s answer to job   had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body   waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one    of course   the last one wasn t very great or anything   i liked it   though not as much as the first two     and more importantly   it wasn t financially successful   a tawdry 55 million bucks !      so back we are   with ripley back as a clone   which means we get another little satirical look at cloning   not that that s a bad thing   but it s becoming a cliche      so she s cloned aboard an even more futuristic looking ship called   the auriga   by some doctors   including the necessary bad government guy   dr   wren   played by j   e   freeman   as well as the little seen dr   gediman   played by none other than brad douriff     mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her    once you get past the fact that you can t figure out where they got her blood   although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one     the film s okay    also on board are a band of mercenary pirates   including michael wincott   ron perlman   kim flowers   raymond cruz   dominique pinon   a jeunet sytable   and       winona ryder   who plays analee call   who turns out to have a bit of a secret   i won t state it   but unless you ve been shacking up with salinger for the past two years   you probably know all about it   although it s nicely covered up      there s a bit of a non sexual yet slightly homoerotic relationship between her and ripley   but it s never really deepened enough    oh well    well   as you might have guessed   the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship    and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship   including some shocks   dan hedaya   for instance   who s death is comical yet sad since   well   he s dan hedaya     and the remaining people   about 7 or 8   are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth    of course   the plot is all balderdash   and just an excuse for some good old   alien    brand fun    the real focus of the series seems to be on style   not really substance   although there s always a bit of it   most notably in   aliens   with the relationship between ripley and the little girl      what s interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach       alien   is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights       aliens   is a wild   tense thriller       alien 3   is a bleak   moody piece of semi noir       alien 4   is kind of like an off beat french film   filled with lots of humor   and cool scares    jean pierre jeunet   without his usual directing partner   marc caro   creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like   das boot   has   with echoes hinting at a possible threat    the chills in the film are really cool   especially with the music   which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes   there s the most tense surgery scene since   face/off   towards the beginning      and not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that    this all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others    there are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed    one is the aforementioned surgery scene    another one takes place between call and ripley   which is just awesome    the underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense   thrilling   and jaw dropping scenes in the entire saga   with a small allusion to jeunet s earlier film     delicatessen        and the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool   with a lovely allusion to   goldfinger        but the best scene in the entire film   i m sure i m not the first to mention it   takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her   she has a an   8   tatooed on her arm      it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga    the screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work   as it never really deapens a lot of the characters    however   it does make us care about most of them   so that when there s very little of them   and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow   we are pretty scared    and   yeah   there are some very funny lines   ripley     who do i have to fuck to get off this boat   !    johner     well   i can get you off    but not this ship        the acting is good all around   with stand out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner   and leland orser   the poor bastad in   se7en   who performed the   lust   sin   as an anxiety ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him    winona ryder is good   but not amazing like she usually is   although she meshes well with the film      of course   and as usual   sigourney weaver steals the show    playing a variation on the ripley character   less emotional   and more rude and bitter     she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable    she s not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for   aliens     but she s just awesome    overall   it s a thrilling   entertaining film which doesn t really amaze like the first two   but is much more amazing than the third installment    the style is the best part of the film   which isn t really a bad thing   but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply    but it s entertaining as hell   and it s definitely fit for the   alien   series    

Pos, the happy bastard s 30 second review  notting hill  a cute romantic comedy from the writer of the hit comedy four weddings and a funeral   notting hill stars julia roberts as anna scott   a very popular actress with a $15 million asking price for movies    one day she wanders into a travel book store owned by a simple london resident   played by hugh grant     and sparks somehow begin to fly    sure   there are points of turmoil   such as putting up with grant s slightly disgusting   but very hilarious   roommate spike   anna s pesky ex boyfriend   alec baldwin in a humorous cameo     and   on top of all that   those damn press    it s a fresh sort of complexity to see in a romantic comedy   very different from   say   a stubborn father or   not the right time   like as seen in usual flicks    roberts is terrific as the astonishingly beautiful actress   and grant is surprisingly good as the straightforward guy still trying to get a hold of what has actually happened with this girl    in short   a sweet romantic comedy that has a lot of good laughs   particularly provided by spike    one tee shirt really says it all about him    in an attempt to turn on a woman   he shows the front of the shirt   which says     you are the most beautiful woman in the world      on the back       fancy a f * * k      

Pos, an energetic   visually stunning   but intellectually hollow recreation of the mysterious life of jeanne d arc    in history jeanne d arc is lost in an ocean of mystery and controversy   which creates the perfect launching pad for talented and creative directors   who can basically alter the story as they wish    she came in a time where people desperately needed a saint    a hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and happiness    director/writer luc besson    nikita     leon    portrays his version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of france and was burned at the stake for witchcraft    besson tries to recreate the person behind the legend    he tries not to show her as a saint or a villain    he shows her as a human being    in a time where blood was almost pouring from the sky   and the air smelled of rotten flesh   it is hard to keep your sanity    the only support and hope is in god    at the age of 13   jeanne   milla jovovich   watches her own sister murdered and raped by the english soldiers    this terrible event makes a lasting impact on jeanne s mind    god is no longer her support    he has become her obsession    she starts seeing visions and signs that command her to raise an army and free france from the siege of the english tyranny    with the help of the wise yolande d aragon   faye dunaway   and charles vii   john malcovich     whose grand royal ambitions and life are at stake   jeanne raises an army and marches towards the english walls    after this the film stays mostly on the battlefield   where besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing action sequences   only occasionally resorting to a calmer tempo    the movie is filled with dreamy   symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship   that create a surreal and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere    the film is lost in time and space   hysterically jumping back and forth in jeanne s thoughts   imagination and conscience    besson s visual style permits the audience to enter the medieval age   feel the smell of fresh blood and the adrenaline pumping in your body in the heat of battle    but the film is far from being flawless    the script needs a lot of polishing    except for jeanne   there are no real characters    and although a grand star cast is assembled   their characters are nothing more than props   not more alive than the costumes that they are wearing    as for the maiden of lorraine herself   she is portrayed as a simple girl   too small for her divine task    in the latter part of the film   we see her as hysterical   confused and on the brink of madness   with her past purity and innocence for ever lost    jovovich handles the part with more panache than one might expect    but though her screen time is incredible excessive   both malcovich    being john malcovich    and dunaway    titus    surpass her rather overacted and simply unprofessional performance    and even hoffman manages to breathe some life into his dreadfully small part    besides casting jovovich   besson s only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting    there are some viscously evil englishmen that murder   pillage and betray with a smile on their faces    and some incredibly brave and noble frenchmen   represented by the   three musketeers   of this story    the brave gilles de rais   vincent cassel     the wise aulon   desmond harrington   and the strong la hire   richard ridings      though all those actor perform well   their characters are nothing more than symbols    banners that proclaim the glory of france    and thus   there is no sense of realism in this film     the messenger  has muscles instead of brains    there is some relief in the end   where besson lays down his armor and starts thinking    dustin hoffman s appearance helps and the film ends elegantly and surprisingly effective with a climax worthy of praise    jeanne s character is unlocked   but whether god was in the picture or not   is never quite explained    was she a confused peasant girl driven by her own hunger for revenge    or was she truly a messenger of god    the film poses as many questions as answers and nothing is completely obvious    bess o messenger  is nothing more than a fairly good film    it is not much that you remember of it after you leave the theater    maybe the sound   the dreamy sequences   but certainly not the dialogue    it is an elegant and adrenaline pumping history lesson for the mtv generation   that although presents some interesting material   works better when it s on the battlefield

Pos, getting it right is a far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movie about male virginity    the film was directed by randal kleiser   who brought us such bubble gum classics as grease and the blue lagoon    but thanks to kleiser s surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script   getting it right is a pleasantly quiet   moving   and memorable film  one geared strictly toward a sophisticated   adult audience    getting it right stars jesse birdsall   emily lloyd s boyfriend in wish you were here   as gavin   a painfully shy 31 year old hairdresser who lives at home with his parents and who  gasp  is still a virgin    gavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon   but expose him to a single 30 year old beauty and he s a mess    much to gavin s surprise   the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan   lynn redgrave     a rich   married   and lonely 45 year old    getting it right is the simple story of gavin s awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right   that is   to find the right woman to fulfill his life    getting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to in depth character development    gavin s self conscious voice over narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche    we observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion to assertive and self confident maturity    birdsall s superb   understated performance as gavin is the real backbone of the film   he seems convincing and authentic throughout    the charm of getting it right also lies in the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavin s life    despite her limited screen time   redgrave makes quite a splash in the movie as gavin s middle aged seducer    for a supporting character   joan is unusually and impressively complex   thanks in large part to redgrave s magnificent performance    gavin is also pursued   or perhaps plagued   by minnie   the totally neurotic daughter of a rich aristocrat    after minnie and gavin meet at a party   she takes great pleasure in disrupting his safe and simple life    helena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role   and sir john gielgud   with his tongue in his cheek   embodies the height of arrogance as her father    gavin s eventual love interest is jenny   the adorable twenty year old single mother who assists him at the beauty salon   london stage actress jane horrocks  fine performance yields a touchingly sweet character    peter cook   the great british satirist   appears briefly in the film as gavin s uptight employer    the scenes of gavin s home life with his parents are also a treat    gavin s over protective mother   pat heywood     whom even woody allen would find overbearing   almost steals the movie    her life seems limited to just two activities   treating gavin like a 10 year old and preparing exotic but inedible meals   such as scalding hot curry and baked chicken with chocolate sauce    gavin and his father s attempts to avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing    getting it right   for the most part   is very well crafted   except for two minor shortcomings    first   the movie is about 15 minutes too long   and consequently it loses momentum at times    second   the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavin s best friend   harry   and his unfaithful lover   winthrop    overall   however   getting it right is quite memorable for its humor   depth   sophistication   and outstanding acting    director kleiser and screenwriter elizabeth jane howard   adapting her own highly acclaimed novel   deserve praise for finding just the right tone for this tale of growth   maturation   and self discovery    

Pos, to me   nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a martin scorsese film    despite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed   the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence    ever since the big success of the action thriller `face/off  in 1997   the hollywood road has been a rocky one for mr   cage    the perpetually awful assassination thriller `snake eyes  was one of 1998 s worst films    `8mm  was a disappointing lost cause    but who better than scorsese to match cage s wit and intensity   which he does in miraculous fashion with `bringing out the dead     cage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce   a new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from day to day    after five years of the stress inducing job   frank basically just staggers onward   relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift finally ends    he also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died under his care   namely a young girl named rose   who stares back at him with pale features at every street corner in new york    frank desperately wants to be fired   but his boss needs him to scour the city and help those in need   `i ll fire you tomorrow         he promises      frank is accompanied by a fresh face every night in the ambulance    the first is larry   john goodman     who always has food on the brain    the second is marcus   ving rhames     a deeply religious black man who incorporates the power of jesus into a regular rescue operation    and finally   tom   tom sizemore   is a deranged sociopath hungry for blood    i found it unique how scorsese used each of these characters for a single shift with frank   but they never figured into the actual plot    each is merely a colorful presence to help develop frank s character   because `bringing out the dead  is predominantly a study of his mind and detailed personality    the one character alongside frank that truly comes into play is mary   patricia arquette     the daughter of a newly admitted patient who suffered from a severe heart attack    arquette   who recently received the wounds of christ in `stigmata    performs well around real life husband cage    it s unfortunate that   after such intriguing character trials and tribulations   the relationship between frank and mary slips during a mishandled   ineffective finale    the movie belongs to the one two punch of cage and scorsese   who were born to collaborate their efforts in an arrangement similar to `bringing out the dead     although it certainly lacks the grit and hard edge of something like `goodfellas    scorsese manages to hit a nerve with his latest picture    the incredible camera work and photography represent stunning flashes of brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration    fans will be pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive   darkly humorous roots after somewhat of a departure with 1997 s `kundun     does `bringing out the dead  rival scorsese s finest work    only occasionally    some of the film feels surprisingly limp   but there is enough energy in it s interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance to suffice    those expecting a grisly   risqu   product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straight arrow approach   but it s still a solid   admirable effort    `bringing out the dead  was written by the acclaimed paul schrader   who collaborated with scorsese on such classics as `taxi driver  and `raging bull     schrader s script is full of moments   wonderful   sharply defined moments   that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering screenplay    the exceptional aspects of the film are it s astounding technical credits and the amazing cast    goodman and sizemore are both electric   well   mainly sizemore     but it s the phenomenal ving rhames who deserves a second look    watch the actor s deeply inspired dedication as he resurrects a gothic band member   and you ll understand why he won a golden globe    `bringing out the dead  is raw and electrifying often enough to mask it s certain flaws    scorsese   and cage   for that matter   have done better   but their intentions are certainly admirable    

Pos, in the opening shot of midnight cowboy   we see a close up of a blank movie screen at a drive in    we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses  hooves    without an image projected onto the screen   the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind s eye    even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie   somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema    but do cowboys really exist   or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper    exploring this theme   director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream   an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept    is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend    midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream   like image of the cowboy   is merely a myth    as joe buck migrates from place to place   he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself   only further degeneration    during the opening credits   joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads `john wayne   the alamo      as joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show   a lady on the air describes her ideal man as `gary cooper   but he s dead      a troubled expression comes across joe s face   as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone    having adopted the image of a cowboy since youth   joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody    joe s persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream    he romanticizes about making it in the big city   but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance    by the end of midnight cowboy   joe buck loses everything and gains nothing    just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen   we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success    but how realistic are these ideals    joe had raped and been raped in texas    the scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york   but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas    alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation    the ability to pack up one s belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention    schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe s abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny    we understand that joe adopts the fa   ade of a cowboy   a symbol of virility and gallantry   as an attempt to neutralize his shame    he runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york    in the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe s encounter with the gay student   joe buck spills ketchup on himself    standing up   we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh    schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe s virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals   signifying emasculation    beyond the symbol of castration   the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin s first sexual encounter   a reference to joe s first homosexual liaison    the fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe s emasculation    it is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients   but effortlessly attracts men    joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity   new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff      there are two predominant images of new york    the first is that new york is the rich   cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty    the other new york is travis bickle s new york   a seedy   corruptive hell on earth    joe envisions new york as the former   but is presented with the latter    mirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine   he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men    joe thinks he is performing a great service for new york   but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions    the people steal joe s money   the landlord confiscates his luggage   and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity    what has become of joe s american dream    schlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party    joe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food   drugs   and sex    at the party   all of joe and ratzo s desires are made flesh   joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami    contrasting joe s daily struggles   shots of warhol s crew display wanton indulgence    there is an irreverence in the partygoers  attitude   we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular   orgies breaking out in the periphery   and drugs passed around like party favors    the party makes a mockery of joe  s ideals    joe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america   scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joe s toils    the american dream   schlesinger suggests   is merely a proletarian fantasy   for those who are content no longer dream   but become indolent    as joe heads to miami   all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him    his masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished    for joe   nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately   he surrenders the identity    tossing his boots into the garbage   he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami    the final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus   more introspective   taking only a few glances outside the window    instead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york   schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe    reflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus  window with joe hardly taking notice    the scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before    the world seems smaller to joe now   the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream    no longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo   he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means    midnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream    there is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians   you can set up a ranch out west and raise a beautiful family    then there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock   with perseverance   can make a fortune in the big city    joe s attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york    during his search for an intangible paradise   joe ends up raping a girl and killing a man    an allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream   joe buck s progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory icons    

Pos, susan granger s review of   hearts in atlantis     castle rock/warner bros      timing is everything   and the timing just seems right for this poignant psychological drama that combines the coming of age nostalgia of   stand by me   with the mystical power of   the green mile      based on stephen king stories adapted by screenwriter william goldman and directed by scott hicks   it s set in 1960 in harwich   connecticut   where fatherless 11 year old bobby garfield   anton yelchin   lives in a boarding house with his resentful   self centered mother   hope davis      he s devoted to his neighborhood friends   mika boorem   will rothhaar   but his pivotal relationship is with a strange   new tenant   ted brautigan   anthony hopkins   who opens the world of literature to him after his selfish mother refuses to buy him a birthday gift and hands him   instead   a library card    knowing he s longing for a schwinn bike   ted offers to pay him $1 a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for signs of the malevolent   ominous low men who are chasing him to exploit his special powers    the story structure consists of one long flashback   framed by the present   featuring the adult bobby   david morse     minimizing the supernatural elements while emphasizing the human drama hopkins  mysterious character is genteel   sensitive and benignly seductive    the only explanation is that he s a psychic who is wanted by the fbi to aid in their hunt for communists and even that seems appropriate   given the inexplicable state of the world right now    the production values and performances are solid   particularly hopkins   arguably the finest   most versatile actor of our era   and the children with whom he forges a firm bond    on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10     hearts in atlantis   is a wistful   enigmatic 8   evolving with subtle power to an emotionally effective catharsis

   sherry stringfield   unidentifiable under big  70s hair   takes on her first big screen gig since she left   er   as rubell s accountant   but she s criminally underused    as the droopy eyed   drug addled steve rubell   myers is worth the price of admission alone    when he s not playing the life of the party   the ex    saturday night live   comedian strips away all of rubell s confidence and swagger to show a man desperately trying to fill his empty   unhappy life with exorbitance   it s a moment worthy of pity when   while lounging on a bed of money and vomiting from a particularly heavy evening   he attempts to seduce one of his employees    and while his performance is largely serious   myers mixes the empathy with a delicate   austin powers    esque wink   thus keeping consistent with   54    s overall feel   gaudy   larger than life and satisfyingly ornamental   not unlike a giant disco ball    

Pos, denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances    this perhaps may be washington s very best to date    he joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent   this season   to become his character   copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly    his very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting   the hurricane   a much better film than it actually is    when his rubin   hurricane   carter feels pain and is tormented by racism   he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy   disgust   and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices    the horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago    the powerful expressions of denzel washington alone   as his tortured carter   sum up the troubles of racism in america s history    he is that amazing    the problem with   the hurricane   is that when compared to washington   all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles    mainly because the script focuses so much on carter   that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors    this is   without a doubt   washington s movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying   it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars    denzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance    as rubin carter   we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system    >from the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a crime he did not commit    then after a successful marriage and boxing career   he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for a triple murder    carter s second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous   powerful white men who refused to let him succeed    from these past experiences in jail   carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of america    after several court appeals   an autobiography   and many public marches for his freedom   carter remained locked in prison    it was not until a young black boy from brooklyn being educated in toronto read carter s book in the 1980 s   that a serious battle for freedom took place    the young boy and his three canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until carter is released    the greatest scenes in the film are when carter begins to lose his mind after spending three months in isolation    washington really shows the breakdown of carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again   he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career    the devastation in washington s eyes show a man who has struggled to do the right thing his whole life only to be punished for it    in the hole   carter attempts to maintain emotional balance but he cannot    his anger is heightened to a point of no control    we see multiple carters   a violent angry one   a silent passive one   and a mediator    we see an emotional boxing match inside carter s head    from this point in the hole to the end of the film   this fight continues    it is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite    when carter sees that white canadians want to help him get out of prison   the angry carter at first erupts    white people have been trying to hurt him his whole life   this reminder leads to anger in his head    however   as the film continues and the canadians continue to help carter we see the calm side him    he realizes that society is changing    that racism is decreasing and now carter wants to leave jail immediately and become a part of this world    very rarely have i seen such determination to perfect his role as washington has done here    if only the other actors had this same determination    dan hedaya   ridiculously plays the man who sends carter to prison twice by forcing witnesses to lie and switching evidence around    it felt like his character was taken straight out of a   scooby doo   episode   he would have gotten away with it if it wasn t for those annoying little kids       the kids   in this film are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with carter underdeveloped and unbelievable    the lawyers who help release carter also are underused   as is clancy brown as a kind prison guard   the complete opposite of his character in   shawshank redemption        there is a great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears    hedaya was superb in   clueless     same for david paymer in   get shorty     harris yulin in   ghostbusters   and liev schreiber in   the daytrippers      it is a mystery how this many actors signed on to such shallow roles    on the other hand   it is absolutely no mystery why denzel washington agreed to play rubin   hurricane   carter    this role is about as far off from shallow as you can get

Pos, director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days   terry gilliam comes to mind as another one      film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story   but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something    but most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story    so whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential   the film almost automatically deserves a good review    and when they add a fascinating story to it   you have nearly perfect entertainment    fincher s the game is no exception to this    the game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time    fincher hasn t made a film since   seven     his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever    so it is about time he made another film    and what a ride it is    the game isn t quite as powerful as   seven     but in some ways it is better    overall   the game could have used a little more clarity   or a little more uncertainty    it walks a line of insanity and reality   but it never goes either way until the very end    the outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events   and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight    unfortunately   unlike   the usual suspects     we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening   whether it be true or false    however   this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent    the game is told completely from its main character s point of view    nicholas van orton   michael douglas   is a high strung and isolated businessman    he lives alone in his giant mansion   divorced from his wife elizabeth   and is celebrating his 48th birthday   the same age at which his father committed suicide at   in the same mansion    for his 48th birthday   conrad   sean penn     the rebel of the family   gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs   consumer recreation services       it will make your life fun again     his brother promises    as skeptical as nicholas is   he is somewhat intrigued   and annoyed by the lack of information  something this businessman hates    seeing a billboard in an office   he decides to visit the mysterious company    jim feingold   james rebhorn   greets nicholas and guides him through the sign up process   which consists of psych tests   physicals   emotional responses   and other mind games       each game is suited to each person s emotional and psychological needs     explains feingold    one day   nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests    even more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up   he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company    what he doesn t realize is that the game has already begun    the phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas  way    how he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive    the detail involved in fincher s shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them    with   seven     fincher had almost every single shot mean something    he also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to    compared to   seven     though   the game is light and comical    because of this film s sense of humor and self awareness   nothing can be taken quite seriously    so don t try to make much sense of what goes on in the game   because it doesn t want you to    what does make sense is the final revelation  when everything becomes apparent and clear    if taken as it is   the game s ending makes complete sense    but if you try and critique every minute detail   then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility    perhaps that is the reason i docked the film    while trying to remain realistic and plausible   the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen    we don t really care if douglas  character lives or not because it isn t believable    the ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously   but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is   you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller    michael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas    douglas has played lonely businessmen before   but here he adds another level to his performance    his character   who is normally level headed and relies on facts   is forced to trust nobody    can he believe the waitress he bumped into    what about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place    douglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well   and gives one of his best performances   even better than his   falling down   persona      the supporting cast is essential in this film   and casting was critical    sean penn is always good   and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas  brother    deborah kara unger   from   crash     is the waitress he bumps into   and her performance is extremely good    in fact   she almost steals the film from douglas    james rebhorn portrays his character very well   and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas  predicament    another good performance comes from armin mueller stahl   from   shine     as the book editor    but considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game   he not only commands this cast   but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life    the game is rated r for language   violence   some gore   and some nudity and drugs    what is essential for this film to work is the writing    john brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue   and some very funny moments    this screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects  did    however   the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot    and if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen   you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year s best films    

Pos, originally launched in 1978   this popular film was re introduced in 1998 to a whole new generation of moviegoers    based on the mighty successful musical from broadway   grease was followed in 1980 with the less stellar grease 2   6   5/10      starring a young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature film roles    plot   high school musical set in the 1950 s showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the t birds   travolta   and the innocent and pure sandy olsen   newton john   from australia    the film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song   dance and humour    critique   fun loving   energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler    this movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the 1950 s   with a superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers    admittedly   i am somewhat biased in this opinion   since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth   grease was one of schmoe s first big screen experiences   and every other scene sends me reeling into the times of my elaborate grease bubble gum card collection     and the lesser responsibilities that i possessed at that time    but apart from the nostalgic vibe   i was still extremely impressed by this film   as it continued to amuse me   despite my previous dozen or so viewings    this film took john travolta from a dim witted   sweathog   on tv s welcome back kotter   and transformed him into a movie star of spectacular proportions   saturday night fever   7   5/10   in 1979 confirmed that sudden popularity      unfortunately for the rest of the cast   his popularity was not terribly contagious   despite their effective showings in this classic movie    on the down side   some of the absolute innocence in this film might bore or turn people off   like when sandy sings about   drinking lemonade   and   staying out until 10   with danny in   summer nights       and the plot isn t exactly the most elaborate story line ever created   but despite these small reservations   this movie carries enough great music and high energy to keep anyone amused through its rapid 110 minute running time   and believe me       i  am not a fan of the musicals ! !      make sure to look for a young lorenzo lamas in the static role of the brainless football player   as well as the national bandstand dance contest as one of the film s absolute highlights    and don t forget to buy the popular soundtrack afterwards   so that you could listen to its peppy tunes whenever you re feeling a little blue    little known facts   henry winkler   of tv s happy days  fonzie fame   turned down the part of danny zuko because he did not want to be typecast for the rest of his career    both travolta and conaway were smitten by newton john during the filming of this picture    conaway eventually bowed out of the woo fest   and married newton john s sister a year later   divorced after five years      

Pos, in `enemy at the gates    jude law is a gifted russian sniper made hero by a political officer named danilov   joseph fiennes   who uses him in a propaganda newspaper to raise the hopes of the soldiers and people of stalingrad    it s world war ii   and the russian german standoff in town could determine the outcome of things for the motherland    law s vassili is the russian s top pawn to victory    lots of war stuff happens    an older   german version of jude s character played by ed harris shows up halfway into the proceedings    he s equally talented   and the two men play a cat and mouse game trying to kill each other    they constantly switch roles   as the war fades far into the background    the cast also includes the terrific rachel weisz as a love interest for both vassili and danilov  the set up is decent   and so are the production values    boasting a wide range of grimy locales   greasy hair   and tattered costumes   the art direction prospers    the actors   however   suffer the problem matt damon had in `saving private ryan     either their eyes   teeth   skin   or a combination of other features looked too white and clean    with dirt and blood all around   the blinding teeth or bright eyes of these actors divert attention from the action    that said   the players are mostly good in their roles   although i don t think ed harris was really trying    maybe he realized his role struck a difficult chord in one notedom    while the film is technically about snipers   there are far too many predictable sniping scenes    director jean jacques annaud expects us to view each tense situation with jude and some cohort in a tight spot as edgy and exciting   but after about the sixth time   in which we realize that jude is not going to die   it s relatively pointless    we get that he s talented   okay   let s move on    that s the problem with `enemy at the gates    it just doesn t know when to stop    witness the wasted seventeen minutes that could have been spent elsewhere    reestablishing his title as the most beautiful   and often talented   man on film   jude law carries the movie    without him   this costly production would have gone into the ground    the story and acting are of good quality   but there s never a sense of authenticity or reality    something about this war movie is undeniably modern   and it loses its feeling    strange enough   the screenplay is based on the true story of a real russian sniper    

Pos, kirk douglas is one of those rare american actors who can say more with a simple glance than most can say with pages of dialogue    all he has to do is look at someone with a raised eyebrow   and you instantly know what he s thinking       detective story   features one of kirk douglas s finest performances    he stars as a new york detective that has his whole world fall apart in one night    the film is based on a play   and this is quite evident   as most of the movie takes place in the one room flat that the detective s work in    the film opens with the douglas character getting ready to go home to his wife   but through a series of events   he never quite makes it there    the bulk of the movie follows the case of a man named schneider   a surgeon who routinely performs abortions with a high fatality rate    however   this schneider character has a connection in the past of douglas s wife   a connection douglas himself is not aware of    many secrets are revealed in the last half hour of this film    secrets i would not dream of giving away    with a name like   detective story     one would assume the film would resemble an episode of   nypd blue     but it doesn t quite work out that way    however   we do see douglas at work on a few other cases throughout the running time    lee grant   virtually unrecognizable   plays a meek jewish woman arrested for shoplifting    her scenes with bendix   another detective   provide the movie with a few laughs    the performances all around are fantastic    douglas may be the leader of this ensemble   but he s not the center of attention all the time    we get to catch a glimpse into other cases and other detectives working on those cases    which brings me back to douglas    he has a really emotional scene towards the end of the picture that really makes you feel for him    we can see that this is a man who has spent his whole life trying to eliminate crime   but has finally realized that what he s really done is gotten back at his criminal father    how he handles coming to terms with this is something really worth seeing    kirk douglas is the kind of actor we don t seem to see to much of these days   he s a tough guy   but the human elements are never hidden too deeply underneath that gruff exterior    

Pos, capsule   bleak and point blank    just the way it should be    makes its case with cold blooded precision and intelligence       serial killer chic   is a relatively new entry to the cultural vocabulary   and one of the more stomach turning ones    i ve never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers   and because of that i had apprehensions about seeing henry    i wasn t sure i wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic hero/antihero    thankfully   that s not the way henry works    the director   john mcnaughton   took a small budget and a gallery of actor friends and created a chilling and intelligent piece of work    it doesn t provide cheap jack explanations for henry s behavior   it shows him up for what he is   an unrepentant and un idolizable man who killed when the mood struck him    at the film s opening   henry s friend ottis toole has a sister   who comes by to stay while she tries to find work in chicago    in a viciously riveting scene   he admits matter of factly to having murdered his own mother   and she covers his hand with hers    they are damned together from that moment on    henry and ottis eventually begin to kill for fun    the movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it   there s a scene where the two go to buy a new tv    the pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words   and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with a soldering iron    no preface    it smashes into us as suddenly as it does the broker    in a scene which many damned the movie for   unseen   they steal a video camera and film the murder of a whole household   playing it back over and over again for their own enjoyment    the movie itself   however   does not glorify the killings   but shows instead that henry feels no joy at his work   only irritation    henry succeeds thanks to excellent writing and direction as well as acting    michael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame   just standing there   and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as well    the producers had originally comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton   but he decided to give them something more memorable   and consequently the film nearly didn t see release    the film does not glorify or justify    it just shows us   with unflinching coldness   what henry was    i m hard pressed to see how anyone can see this and consider henry any kind of   victim   or   hero      then again   probably   so would henry    

Pos, a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal    a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation state against another    a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain    a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end    if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy   the violence continues    it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone   even total innocents     anywhere   at anytime that gives the figure his label    edward zwick s the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states    you d think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines    arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad   and the u   s   responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack    however   unlike the real life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden s camp and manufacturing facility   the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal    in retaliation   the terrorists bring the fight to the new world    unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent in charge anthony hubbard   denzel washington     who works out of the bureau s new york office at one federal plaza    while investigating a series of bombings in the big apple   he encounters cia agent elise kraft   annette bening     also trying to uncover information    generally   the fbi is charged with problems inside the u   s     while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm    even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country    hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory   but as the two form a tentative professional relationship   hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government    the original tagline for patriot games was     there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil      however true   it was pulled before the movie s release because it sounded too much like a dare    revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states   the siege is almost an invitation in itself   because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america    admittedly   the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive   who s going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two thirds       but the basic premise is still valid    i liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action thriller fare of good guy g men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order    it provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab american population   and that in an effort to find the terrorists   the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself    in fact   about halfway through the film   when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city   the liberties of all americans are put at risk    although it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign   the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups    throughout   the film maintains a conflict between hubbard   who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law   and general devereaux   bruce willis     who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully    what results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act   utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides    it actually gets rather heady at times   but it s a credit to screenwriters zwick   lawrence wright   and menno meyjes that they don t underestimate the intelligence of the audience    i don t know if it s his tone or inflection or something else   but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great    this   combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid level authority figure   makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable    annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i ve seen recently   and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable    it s somewhat unfortunate that her character s fortitude is broken at a certain point   but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range    bruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough guy role   always standing straight   and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face    however   the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film s development    notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad   a lebanese immigrant    the role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage   and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society    difficult to say the least   shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch    perhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom   wings     shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night    whereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick s favorite actor   he directed washington in glory and courage under fire     james horner seems to be his favorite composer    i therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score writer graeme revell   seven films this year already   over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian themed music   and horner s record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish sounding at most    revell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole    it s nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we ve been getting throughout the year    missteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes    for example   it s pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick    unfortunately   there s a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions   obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye catching    in the middle of the city   and against no real opposition     zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops    verisimilitude really goes out the window at that point    the film also gets a little preachy toward the end   focusing on the ability of different races to get along    a noble gesture   the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously    these flaws are glaring   but they don t detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class    

Pos, with the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news lately   what with that whole clinton thing going on   you know   100 million bucks to discover the president got boinked by an intern   oh   please   government   waste my taxes just a bit more   would you        it s about time tony scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement    with this and   crimson tide     he s created two successfully chilly films that are interesting   exciting   even pretty smart   but never totally riveting as cinema   and the problem i think with each of these films is that each film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying   and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart    that film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whether or not to follow rules or question them   and was appropriately scary and all   but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant       enemy of the state   is the same way   it s engrossing for its entire running time   and it s scary the way that it shows a man s decent into kafkaism   but it s too technical    it s too cold and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be    it casts will smith   one of the better big budget leading men in movies these days because he s charming and witty and never uninteresting   and hopes that his charisma can make up for his character not being well developed enough to really be a person    i hate to do this   but last year s film   the game   got it damn perfect   it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being   a man who is cold and has cut off everyone from his life   and then pulls everything he thought he had as a security blanket away from him and watched what happened    the result was not only a film that was exciting and chilling   but also the best mindfuck of the entire year    not that i want every kafkaesque film to be   the game     this year s   the spanish prisoner   succeeds with less thrills and chills     but it should be an example of what works and what doesn t    will smith s character is   frankly   too perfect   at least too movie perfect    he had an affair with another woman   lisa bonet   ha ha     but his relationship with his wife   regina king   is basically fine regardless    he has a kid   and he s raking in money as a lawyer   albeit a very good and reasonably moral one    so he generally doesn t have any real problems as a human being   and is therefore boring       except that he is played by will smith   who embodies him with about as much will smith charm as he can without entering   id4   /   men in black   territory    he s a good dramatic actor   just see the first half hour of   six degrees of separation   for proof of this   not that he isn t great the whole time     and here   he makes his character likable and sympathetic without any real strain on his character   which makes the film lack any real deep interesting qualities    smith becomes involved in a mass conspiracy involving the assasination of a senator opposed to a government law that would create world surveillance   extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world   under the pretense that it would make crime easier to control   when he is passed a disk of the event caught on tape by an outside party   a nature observer played by   uh   jason lee      the government wants the disk   and is prepared to destroy his life to get it    as smith s plight is dramatized   we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him   sitting in vans disguised as other businesses   staring at computers and pulling out tricks faster than a speeding bullet    these guys   played by jack black   jamie kennedy   and seth green   are the most interesting part of this film because they re   well   fascinating   they re doing their jobs   which are evil   but the film doesn t view them as such   and they almost become our friends    we like these guys for the sole reason that the film doesn t automatically judge them as the villains    they re also scary because we get the idea that they re not fully aware of the impact their jobs have on the world    it s as if they re obsessed with their jobs   not because they re evil   but because   hey   it s a fun job   and no one else can do it like them    unfortunately   this also backfires a bit on the film   instead of being the flashlight in the darkened room that   the game   was   you see everything   and are thus not as freaked out because you know what is going on    sure   you re chilled   but you re not exacty freaked out by what s going on    but what do you expect from tony scott   the man who never met a five second piece of film he ever liked    he s a not bad director because   hell   he is always interesting to watch   if not occasionally moronic   exhibit a     days of thunder       but the reason he s not great is because he s too technical and calculated    his shots are perfectly executed   and leave nothing to the imagination   and they re always making sure you re paying attention    this is incredibly annoying   and it reduces   enemy of the state   to a mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths   but still manage to entertain without any real problems    despite never actually becoming great   it s never actually boring and it s always intriguing    watching the government set up smith is endlessly fascinating   and since we care about smith s likeable protagonist   we are set up for a good two hours worth of tom clancy esque entertainment    add the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen film   everyone from gabriel byrne to dan butler pop up for cameos     and you ve got a good old fashioned escapist drama which does all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow will smith s plight without a minute s worth of boredom

Pos, bob the happy bastard s quickie review    i must admit   no doubt s single   new   is quite catchy    it was bouncy and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director doug limon   the man who had brought us the humorous swingers a little while back    the result    a movie that s just as good as that song   really    it follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend    first we hear about a grocery bagger   sara polley   who runs into a monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave   with bad results   as a drug dealer feels he s been swindled by her     then comes the story of an english grocery store worker   same store   who heads to vegas for the weekend with friends   where sex   gunplay   and stolen car trouble come into play   then we see the story of two gay movie actors   played by scott wolf and jay mohr   who deal with a cop s strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl   sara   with their car   and   finally   we come to another grocery worker   katie holmes   who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer   the one mentioned earlier      really   it s all confusing to keep track of in review format   your best bet is to just   well   go    the movie features some very good acting from all angles   and limon adds the same humorous energy he had with swingers to this particular product    the dialogue is pretty snappy and the resolution is pretty well realized   not going for the sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending    think of it as a   well   ending    the intertwining of stories is a particularly good element to the movie   as it s never really confusing and tells different sides of the story   like sliding doors kinda did    however   it s better suited for the younger generation who want a little spice in their flicks   which sliding doors kinda isn t    

Pos, a couple of months ago   when i first downloaded the face/off trailer from the net   my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold  yawn     followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key   not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this piss poor trailer    then i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u   s           unique       excellent         must see    well   i thought still skeptical   i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here     here    of course   was still three months away    i ll admit   when i trotted off to see this film   the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow    i d heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled   but his films were definitely not on my must see list    that   let me tell you   has changed completely    i knew this fact only five minutes into the film   after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet    the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick    seriously    i ve never been a big john travolta fan   but he   like cage   perfectly suited his role in the movie           sorry    make that  roles  in the movie    even travolta s great performance   however   paled in comparison to cage s character portrayals    my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler s hideout    half drugged out of his mind   he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his son s death from castor s perspective     doesn t it just break your heart     he mutters coldly    now don t go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie   it s not    that s what really makes this movie unique    it s an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters           not a common mix at all    suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though           that s  the only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around 5671 rounds at each other         and  never hit    several action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press  rewind  and watch it over again    the part where archer and troy have a stand off on either side of a double sided mirror is just plain brilliant    whilst cage s and travolta s performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies   the lesser characters are just as intriguing    joan allen   who usually sticks to the straight drama movies   plays her part perfectly as archer s long suffering wife    i like the fact that her character didn t end up toting a gun at the end of the movie       it  would have wrecked her potrayal    gina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troy s mistreated girlfriend           make that * one of * castor troy s mistreated girlfriends    other movies would have used her character as just window dressing       a  sex object   but instead her character is very strong and independent    dominique swain   who plays archer s daughter   also does a nice job   though her character is not as explored as much as allen s or gershon s    faults   well       there were some i have to say    first   the movie s ending   whilst being very good overall   was a bit too drawn out for it s own good    after the two combatants begin duelling again after the final boat crash you can t help but think     geez   are you guys nuclear powered or what        there were certain bits that weren t handled properly   like where archer appears safe and sound on solid ground after jumping off the converted oil platform/prison   more explanation here would have been nice    overall   this movie was not perfect    but i thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect    many critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies are made           i  certainly hope so    

Pos, go s is a gloriously slick hip machine    director liman   who also photographed go   and screenwriter august celebrate the drug/rave scene in l   a     preferring to take   comedic   snapshots of troubled youth rather than critique them    after more than ninety minutes of pill popping   tantric sex   car chases   and attempted murder   go even has a happy ending    this is the sort of film that gives members of the dove foundation splitting headaches   as go wound down   i anticipated an anti pill popping casual tantric sex car chase attempted murder sermon that   blessedly   didn t arrive    a la tarantino s pulp fiction   go is comprised of three separate but related stories    the basics are as follows   ronna   polley   is a bitter grocery store clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for extra dough    her co worker   simon   the improbably named askew     is a clubber from britain ecstatic about his first trip to vegas    zack   mohr   and adam   wolf   are soap opera stars escaping a career threatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop   fichtner   in a drug bust    perhaps because the innovative structure of tarantino s non linear masterwork is by now old hat   the id fueled go delighted me but rarely surprised me   with the exception of that mind reading cat !      pulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen   but we see go s wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last    torontonian polley   of the sweet hereafter   refused to do publicity for this picture on the basis that she was   not pleased with   her turn as the ill fated cashier    in go   she delivers   hands down   her best performance to date    here s an   overrated   actress who agreed to appear on the poster   but not support her team at the junket or in interviews   this sort of arrogance is commonplace for ms   polley   as anyone who has read of her political agenda in the canadian press will tell you    if she doesn t want to be the ingenue of the moment   she should have said   no     not go    but i digress    go is a fun film   so chipperly depraved one can t help but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride    in that sense   it s a departure from liman s last film   swingers   which at least lectured against self absorption in the form of vince vaughan s trent and his subtle comeuppance in the story s clever epilogue   which has been aped by mcdonald s for their latest commercial      i wish i cared more about go s characters   like the techno music they listen to   the bands of anarchists on display here are at once absorbing and vacuous    when the lights came up and stung my eyes   it was difficult to recall what about it entertained me    yet entertain me it did    go is light and frothy   featuring compelling if not endearing work by polley   timothy olyphant   scream 2     and especially fichtner   whose homoerotic behavior is milked for effective laughs    fichtner is a character actor best known for playing backstabbers   in heat   armageddon   and others     his previously untapped comic abilities shine in go    unlike much of the film   fichtner is unpredictable    

Pos, kolya is one of the richest films i ve seen in some time    zdenek sverak plays a confirmed old bachelor   who s likely to remain so     who finds his life as a czech cellist increasingly impacted by the five year old boy that he s taking care of    though it ends rather abruptly   and i m whining    cause i wanted to spend more time with these characters   the acting   writing   and production values are as high as   if not higher than   comparable american dramas    this father and son delight   sverak also wrote the script   while his son   jan   directed   won a golden globe for best foreign language film and   a couple days after i saw it   walked away an oscar    in czech and russian   with english subtitles    

Pos, note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    the teaser trailers for my best friend s wedding scarsely gave reason for hope   it looked like the sort of goofy   light hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight   but little more   i d frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often    it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend s wedding was such a success   a strong   bouyant romantic comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects   featuring a triumphant performance from ms   roberts    the heroine of my best friend s wedding is julianne potter   julia roberts     a successful new york restaurant critic   and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes   rupert everett   that years ago   she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex lover michael o neal   dermot mulroney     a sports writer   that if they both hadn t married by the time they reached 28   they had promised to marry each other    both julianne and michael are both single   of course   and when george inquires about michael s age   julianne realizes that he s mere weeks away from his 28th birthday   and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day    however   she finds herself even more distraught when michael s call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace   cameron diaz     and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding   julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael   and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary    the setup for my best friend s wedding   then   is a fairly conventional one   and in many ways the film s storyline is formulaic   but only to a certain extent   the film was directed by p   j   hogan   whose first feature   muriel s wedding   had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly duckling story   and the same holds true for my best friend s wedding   which confidently combines traditional romantic comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour    the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr   hogan    for example   there s a heartfelt   emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film   with a trio of teenagers   inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks   harmonizing in the background    my best friend s wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film   and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect   it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen s everyone says i love you   i d even assert it s a more successful one    my best friend s wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well    in a typical romantic comedy   kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty   conniving ice queen   and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps   this film is smarter than that   here   kimmy is sweet   sincere   and innocent   julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy s life   she d actually like her too    the george character is almost a staple of recent film   the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason   but in my best friend s wedding   he gets to have a playful   mischievous and charming personality    throughout the film   the formulaisms one often sees is romantic comedy are given little twists   and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion    there is a lot of smart writing in the well paced screenplay by ronald bass   we re given four interesting   vivid   and likeable characters   with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments    my best friend s wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts   who turns in a top notch   confident and reassured performance as julianne    this isn t the sort of role one usually associates with ms   roberts   the julianne character s neurotic   fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role   but ms   roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here   remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience   if not entirely sympathetic   even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable    even better than ms   roberts though is cameron diaz   who turns in a shining performance in my best friend s weddding    with a smile which lights up the screen   she effectively conveys kimmy s insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner   and never hits a false note in the film    she even sings   i won t soon forget her charming serenade of   i just don t know what to do with myself      rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george   and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film    his george is a bit of a devilish rogue   entirely affable   and mr   everett s performance is a delight to watch   he s clearly having fun   and his joy is infectuous    dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role   unlike the other characters in the film   he s not given a lot to do   but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms   roberts and mr   mulroney   and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic    when julia roberts  lustre began to fade   and she was usurped from her title as   america s sweetheart   by sandra bullock   i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile    while that didn t quite work out   it s near certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990   the romantic comedy   will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game    my best friend s wedding marks a return to form for ms   roberts   and cements p   j   hogan s reputation as a skilled director of comedy    

Pos, after the average mouse hunt   the silly small soldiers and the entertaining antz   dreamworks try again with the children s film market with this stunning adaptation of the moses story    as the film warns us at the beginning   it s not the full story   and some liberties have been taken   but generally this the bible story we all know and love   featuring burning bushes   the plagues and the parting of the red sea    the only thing missing is charlton heston    instead   we get val kilmer voicing moses   an hebrew who is placed in a river by his mother and rescued by the queen of egypt   helen mirren      we flash forward several years to see moses and brother rameses   fiennes   all grown up    moses soon finds out from brother and sister miriam and aaron   sandra bullock and jeff goldblum   that he isn t really the son of the pharaoh seti   patrick stewart   and that it his destiny to free the hebrews from the egyptians tyrannical rule    he soon sets about this   along with his wife tzipporah   michelle pfeiffer      rameses and his two wizard friends   voiced by steve martin and martin short   try to stop moses completing his task    while the plot is familiar and somewhat exciting for adults   for children reared on aladdin and hercules   this film could be the most godawful thing they ve ever seen    gone is the quick fire humour and standard   easy to follow plot    but   spectacularly   and to dreamworks credit   nearly every child in the audience was captivated by the story and events happening on screen    jeffrey katzenberg   who produced this film   certainly knows how to keep a child interested    he s included some songs in the film   plus some comedy   and a exciting chariot chase   to keep the children interested    and somehow   himself and the directors still manage to get all the drama and intensity of the story across   without ever being boring    it s a remarkable achievement    also remarkable is the animation   which puts hercules   an almost  slap dash  effort   to shame    relying on hand drawn and computer animation   the backgrounds and characters are amazingly detailed    the film seems a little caught up with it s amazing visuals by showing a lot of sweeping visuals and  moving  shots   but they  do  look incredible    the final  plague  where god kills every first born child   and the parting of the red sea have to be seen to be believed    kudos to the animators    the vocal talent is also very good    val kilmer does a fine job as moses   although he doesn t sing   and ralph fiennes is superb as rameses   and he  does  sing      sandra bullock and jeff goldblum are great   and steve martin and martin short are very good   but not in the film long enough    finally   michelle pfeiffer does excellent work as moses wife    kudos also goes to the voice of god   who instead of booming and bombastic is quiet and subdued    sadly   he is uncredited   and i couldn t quite work out who the voice was       but e mail if you do      the songs are good   ranging from the usual love sonnets to the traditional big production number    they don t disturb the movie   and while not particularly memorable   they are nice to listen to   they re well sung aswell      the musical score is suitably epic   with some beautiful tunes    coupled with the superb visuals   the prince of egypt is a visual and aural treat   backed up with a great story    entertaining both for kids and adults   this film is a must see    a david wilcock review   1998     you know   for kids     norville barnes  

Pos, those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugo s novel les miserables    i don t know if a lot of people have   though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel    i haven t even seen that    going into this film   i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters   i even expected the film to be a musical      walking away from it   i m kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material    writer/director bille august s film version is a straightforward   beautifully told film    liam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean   in the beginning   he has just been released from a 19 year prison sentence    he is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior    the priest s words of wisdom influence him   and he makes a vow to change himself    nine years later   we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo   nobody knows his real name   and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago    conflicts arise when inspector javert   geoffrey rush   is assigned to vigo    valjean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him   and javert remembers jean to be a convict    javert is hell bent on upholding the law   and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice    along the way   valjean meets and falls in love with a peasant woman   fantine   uma thurman     and vows to take care of her daughter   cosette   played later by claire danes      les miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture    the production design by anna asp is authentic and vast   and the sets don t look like sets   they look like real towns and villages     gabriella pescucci s costumes are noticeably spectacular    basil poledouris  soundtrack is thick and usually well placed   though it does get a bit heavy at times      many scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality   such as the climax   which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening    augusts keeps the story simple   which i hear is a good thing   since the novel is so complex   and easy to follow    he manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately    i was also impressed that he didn t go overboard with flash and style   which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days   such as baz luhrmann s vicious tragedy william shakespeare s romeo + juliet      this film feels solid and whole   and each scene has a certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested    liam neeson is terrific in the main role   neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well   and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective    thurman   in her small role   is very good   and proves that she has a lot of range and can perform in a very non glamorous role such as this one    rush is absolutely incredible as javert   i don t remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here   he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances   and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense    i can t be as charitable for danes   however   though i know she is a talented actress   here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit    les miserables is   as i ve said   a solid   intelligent motion picture    my only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy   and perhaps too staged    each scene is grand and huge   and exploding with poledouris  score   but i didn t always want them to be    for the most part   les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture    it s a good movie   and tells its story well   but august tends to hand feed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle    however   in a film this exciting and well produced   a few minor flaws are easily overlooked

Pos, driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small   intimate story    it s a quiet film   a slow film   a deliberate film    but if you re patient with it   the movie offers innumerable rewards   such as a pair of self assured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy    driving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry s pulitzer prize winning play of the same name   which first opened in new york four years ago    the play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago   los angeles   london   vienna   norway   and the soviet union    uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy   he also penned the wonderful sleeper   mystic pizza    the film   like the play   is set in atlanta   georgia   and it revolves around two people in their twilight years   a cranky   70 something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60 something black man who becomes her chauffeur    the movie relies on character   rather than plot   to propel the action    in fact   the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense   it doesn t present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together    rather   driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life   shopping   listening to the radio   visiting the cemetery   eating fried chicken   and so on    the film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta s history   including the 1958 bombing of the temple   the city s oldest jewish congregation   and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr   martin luther king   jr    the story begins in 1948 with daisy   tandy   crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway    the insurance company cancels her insurance   and her son   boolie   decides to hire her a chauffeur    freeman   reprising his role from the play   plays the chauffeur   hoke    the film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger    driving miss daisy is a movie about human nature   aging   prejudice   and a great many other things   but more than anything it s about a relationship   one that spans 25 years   4 cars   the advent of civil rights   and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon    daisy is strong willed and set in her ways   and   from the outset   she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur    initially   she treats hoke with contempt   refusing to let him drive her anywhere    once she does get in the car   daisy is the ultimate back seat driver    to make matters worse   she is extremely self conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand    eventually   however   daisy is worn down by hoke s good natured charm and infectious cheer   she softens and opens up to him    tandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well   but unfortunately this feisty   cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace    we ve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations   from on golden pond to cocoon    nevertheless   tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own    freeman   as hoke   on the other hand   gives the more distinctive of the two performances    there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color    hoke is uneducated and illiterate   but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man   an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior    both freeman and tandy seem to be in their element   in full command of their natural charisma    they flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves    they bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie s gentle humor    at the same time   tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama    in his first dramatic role   dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie   tandy s loving and patient son    drama seems to agree with aykroyd   taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor   especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently   ghostbusters ii   the great outdoors   my stepmother is an alien      the only other significant characters in the film are daisy s housekeeper   idella   marvelously played by esther rolle     good times       and boolie s pretentious wife   played by patti lupone    under the direction of bruce beresford   crimes of the heart   tender mercies     driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again    but fortunately   beresford never forgets he s shooting a movie   and accordingly   he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches   such as gorgeous shots of flowers   trees   and tomatoes    in adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen   the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety    uhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say    beresford wisely exercises restraint in the film s dramatic moments    the movie tugs at your heart   but it never goes for the jugular    the only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees    

Pos, albert brooks saves the day   just in the nick of time    with a very poor summer for movies   brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up   and does so in a positive way    while this may not be his finest work     the muse   still shakes up some delightful humor    in albert brook s latest comedy   he tells a story of a troubled screenwriter   brooks   who s losing his edge   as his business partners say    in desperation   he goes to see his friend jack   jeff bridges     who has been a very successful screenwriter in the past    he asks jack for some help   and recieves word of a real life muse   that has helped him and many other directors throughout their career    so brooks seeks the muse named sarah   sharon stone     and is suckered into buying her expensive   food etc   as a sort of payment    the real punch line however   doesn t come until the end    it really makes you wonder   how screenwriters really get their ideas   could it simply be from a friend or a bum in the street    the idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in a hilarious manner    speaking of brooks   he was absolutely hysterical as a screenwriter    every time he graces the screen   i can t help but start laughing    albert has a very unique sense of humor that makes him a very likeable character    the real problem with the film lies with sharon stone    she wasn t likeable at all    brooks had the right idea with her occupation   but she never pulled through    in a way   she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak    luckily brooks could clean up the mess   and cover for stone s mishap    it was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance   because   the muse   had the potential to a be a very authentic comedy    on a brighter note   andie macdowell was also charming as brook s wife    she is always a nice addition as a supporting actress   because she has that charisma that seems to complete the atmosphere to any film she s in    the funniest moments in   the muse   in my opinion were the cameos by james cameron and martin scorsese    i mean imagine   brooks seeing these big named directors in his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice   like it was something out of the ordinary    it was just plain hilarious    it just adds to the satire joke   of how directors get ideas    brilliant move by brooks    as i mentioned before   the film is a satire much like it s proceeder bowfinger   which came out a few weeks before    unlike bowfinger   this is not a mean spirited film that s desperate for jokes   it s rather a witty and humorous look at hollywood       bowfinger   had it s moments   but had quite a few problems that were never worked out   but   the muse   still managed to keep the laughs despite a bit of a detour    by the end of the film   you re glad to see a good hearty comedy come out of it    for once i m not fully disappointed   because the film didn t slow down   it kept moving   even with some flaws    thumbs up to brooks for his brave effort    i think he ll still manage to keep his edge around well into the future    

Pos, after being hypnotized   a man believes there is a ghost in his house    the review  two low key summer horror films have become surprise financial successes this year   the blair witch project and the sixth sense    each has made well over $100 million in north america   based on a combination of strong word of mouth and clever advertising    if a film s box office take were based primarily on its quality   stir of echoes would join blair and sense in grossing far more money than expected   for it is as scary   if not scarier than the other two    writer/director david koepp has given artisan entertainment   the folks who distributed blair witch a second creepy hit    the story gets going after tom witzky   bacon     an average blue collar dad   gets hypnotized by his wife maggie s   erbe   sister lisa   douglas   at a party    while the hypnosis goes as expected to the party goers   it triggers something in tom s head    things begin to change around him   blinking red lights let off a strange hum   for example     and he fights to stay in control of his own senses    where these experiences take tom   maggie and their son jake   cope     who tom thinks might have some answers   is down a dark path that will scare and disturb you    david koepp keeps the action localized   the majority of the action takes place at tom s house or just down the street    by keeping things at home   koepp is able to proceed without having to resort to any clumsy segues   montages of driving down roads as we move from one city to another etc        unfortunately   the dread and spookiness of stir of echoes are frequently interrupted by moments of levity    humour can take the tension away from a scene faster than any shoddy special effect or poor acting    several tense moments become completely diffused by a few misplaced jokes    also   there are a couple of plot developments that are left unresolved   though to mention them would be to give too much away    kevin bacon handles the duel task of playing an everyman and a man losing his sanity admirably    his total lack of understanding of what is happening to him is believable   as are the reactions from his wife maggie    kathryn erbe is given a role meatier and better written than that of most   wife who can no longer handle her husband   parts    while it is still a supporting role   her maggie is moving as she watches both her husband and her son enter what she calls   a private club that i m not invited to     where they whisper about things all day long    as jake   zachary cope equals the performance of haley joel osment in the sixth sense   but gets less screen time    both children manage the same trick   making the audience creeped out by their apparent acceptance of the way things are    fans of blair and sixth sense will almost surely love stir of echoes    it combines the dread of blair   a creepy closed in feel thanks to cinematographer fred murphy and great performances by the whole cast   specifically bacon   to give the fall its first genuine scary film    if only they had let up on the unneeded funny bits and tweaked the plot a bit more   this could have been one of the year s best    

Pos, available for rental   october 12   1999  10 things i hate about you is an update of the classic play   the taming of the shrew    that said   drop any pre conceived notions of what shakespeare s work is supposed to be like and welcome yourself to padua high school   home of a student counselor   allison janney   who obsesses over the male penis   a slightly too hip and racist african american english teacher   daryl mitchell     a new kid named cameron   joseph gordon levitt     a model named joey   andrew keegan     the subject of cameron and joey s crushes   bianca   larisa oleynik     and bianca s sister   the shrew   julia stiles in a marvelous performance     whose name is katarina   kat for short    with movies about high schools similar to these running through projectors like water down the nile   it would be quite easy to write off 10 things i hate about you as just another doltish comedic romance    yet   you must realize that the story is timeless   and a few hundred years later it is equally as witty and comical as when elizabeth gleefully looked on   groundlings below and stuffed brassieres on stage    the first reminder of the original scribe can be found in katarina and bianca s last name   stratford    their family is run by walter stratford   pretty woman s larry miller     a doctor who is all too familiar with teenage pregnancy and guards his children accordingly    in what he thinks to be a moment of ironic humor   the family   no dating   policy is amended to   bianca can date       when  [katarina] does      with prom just ahead   bianca s fate is grim   unless   of course   she can tame the shrew    don t think this mission to be a simple one   as bianca kindly points out   her sister         is a particularly hideous breed of loser      getting katarina to date is complex and oftentimes confusing    when cameron   who likes bianca   learns of her father s new rule   he is quick to consult a friend for advice    the scheme they dream up is to fully exploit   someone with money      in this case   that is joey   the other guy with a crush on bianca    cameron s friend   a loser by teenage verdict   convinces joey to pay someone who has enough guts to take the shrew out    the solution lies no farther away than the second blatant reminder of the master scribe   patrick verona   heath ledger      this verona is far from fair   rumor has it that he previously laid his scene in prison    moreover   katarina openly opined to the aforementioned english teacher that   hemingway was an alcoholic who hung around picasso   hoping to nail his leftovers      the laws of high school cinema inexorably turn patrick and katarina into romeo and juliet    providing a constant reminder of the fact that this isn t exactly what shakespeare had in mind are the elements obligatory to a high school comedy   a party polluted with liquor   a best friend s betrayal   and prom    it is the latter that has become infamous for closing films like drive me crazy   american pie   never been kissed   carrie   she s all that   and can t hardly wait    yet surely even these practices have roots in shakespeare   falstaff was a drunk   romeo and juliet met at a party   and caesar learned about loyalty the hard way    

Pos, seen july 8   1998 at the crossgates cinema 18     albany   ny     theater #7   at 8   15 p   m   with my mom using hoyts cinema cash    [theater rating   * * * 1/2   very good sound   picture   and seats]  it s very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic   vivid sense of reality and life    all stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters  lives   but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do    therefore     gone with the wind   deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does   in such a crafted   intricate   and entertaining manner    it s a crowning achievement   not only in filmmaking   but for storytelling itself    the film takes place in georgia before   during   and after the civil war    this plays a major factor in the film s success    to use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy    it might also seem cliche   boring and other such deterent factors to potential viewers    can a story set so long ago be relatable now    the film confronts all these problems   paradoxically   by not cronfronting them    it doesn t simply plug in the   right thing   at the   right time     it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant    building a strong foundation is important to all forms of media   without which   what is there to build on    we re given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters   especially our main character   scarlett o hara   leigh     a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel   a cunning wit   and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time    she knows how her society works   wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her    right from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be    being the most sought after woman allows her to manipulate men   and their women   to ensure she gets her way   whether it be obvious   i   e    who will be the one to get her food     or subtle   i   e    getting married just to spite someone      the man she claims to love is ashley wilkes   howard     a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him    he isn t so arrogant and demanding as scarlett   in fact   he s engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his    her name is melanie   de havilland     and she is one of the sweetest   kindest   and most likable characters one will ever see    she and scarlett become very dear friends   but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her   and the love she has for her husband    her meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic   it defines who she is   but doesn t give her much emotional self defense    acting a catalyst to the love triangle   and to the story as a whole is the daper   stong willed   cunning   cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler   gable      he s quite a character all right   everyone listens to what he has to say even though he s got a bad reputation    butler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior    he tells everyone the much needed truth in the rigid caste like society where freewill doesn t seem to exist   everything is done out of honor and tradition    for example   in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there s no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out    this angers them   not for his lack of faith   but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that       do we have ammunition factories    do we have food    do we have a navy    all we have is tobacco      all true statements and yet the south still insists he s wrong    butler is a shifty character to be sure   but he takes such pride in his arrogance it s appealing    scarlett notices this too when she first sees him   and from the look butler gives her   we know he s not going to stop until he has her    but scarlett can t get past her need for ashley   and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story   butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever    and so the story goes on   with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life    the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband   especially after she is   marked   for life when her first husband dies    this gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story    some are vital for only a few scenes   but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film    in most films only a few characters exist for support in background   but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance    even people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set    the costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place    the filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside   real world   but these types of simple approaches are never taken    the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war    fleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is    one scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming     no !  not my leg !  don t cut off my leg !    another scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street   but as the camera pulls back   we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers   but it is their moaning that s more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be    as the second half begins   the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single handedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north    she manages to resurrect the family plantation   but all the willpower she has can t help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south s ultimate defeat    this brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love  hate relationship    most of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship   or lack thereof   between rhett and scarlett    each uses the other for personal gain   but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other    scarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett can t help but want her more every time she tries to one up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business    they say opposites attract   but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities   it borders on magnetic polarization    they need each other and know this   yet they never seem truly happy together    perhaps they mistake love for passion   and the film leaves it up to us to make this call    both have things the other wants and vice versa   but when they compromise   is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other    love and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film   we re left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why    gable and leigh do have great chemistry   always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture    all    none    either way is possible and it s a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings    it s safe to say most of us won t live such overly dramatic lives as those in   gone with the wind     but it s still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that we ve just experienced a life s worth of joy and pain

Pos, city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most   thought provoking   moving   and completely unsentimental    i find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant   which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality    city of angels is a wonderful film   enhanced by interesting and well rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years    it s a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story   and avoids most of the cliches we re so used to seeing in films like this    city of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders  1988 film wings of desire    i have yet to see wings of desire   so i am   unfortunately   unable to make a comparison of the two    i have heard   however   that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways   which makes me glad that this film isn t a rip off of its source material    nicolas cage stars as seth   an angel who   like all of his angel counterparts   is present to lead the dying to heaven   or somewhere just like it      one day   he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr   maggie rice   meg ryan     and his attention is called to her    the angels can make themselves seen to humans   but they can t experience any of the senses   most importantly   touch      he shows himself to maggie   and she falls for him   unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status    seth wants to become human so he can feel her    that s when he meets nathaniel messinger   dennis franz       former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race         as a side note   i found messinger to be the most fascinating character   for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death      messinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human    seth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel   i know   it sounds ridiculous   but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well done     after much deliberation   she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel    this   of course   is when seth decides to take the plunge   literally   from a building   when he wakes up from the fall   he is human   and happy to feel what it s like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead    since i love this film so much   i ll make a minor note that it certainly isn t perfect    although it is original and mesmerizing   it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre    the plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic   though the details are what make the story excellent   and steel has done a great job with them      the ending   too   could have been more powerful and less predictable    these elements are minor   though   and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels    the acting is superb from everyone involved    this is perhaps my second favorite performance from cage   my favorite being the rock      he s quiet and pensive   and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly toned words    he s perfect for a role like this   and at the same time he reassures us he s not bound by playing the psycho   though he is good at it   as he shows in face/off      meg ryan is a powerful   enticing   and appealingly chirpy actress   and her work here is some of her best    dennis franz   however   steals all of his scenes as the energetic former angel    what i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation    director brad silberling is a talented man   and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters   rather than forced sentimentality    his direction is steady   and he shows this in just about every scene   near the beginning   maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead    there is no music or elaborate camera work   we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information    this is the way stories should be told   and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real    the film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do    cinematographer john seale   the english patient   provides some of the most stunning images i ve seen on the big screen   hundreds of black clad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours   just as an example      the music   by gabriel yared   also of the english patient     is perfect for this film   it s quiet and moody music   but not sentimental !     and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely    the visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far    all of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre    it s a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story across  the excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously    

Pos, robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible   god given gifts   but are able to act like ordinary people    in   the natural     1984     he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs   the baseball player who was destined to be   the best there ever was     but still acted like a humble farm boy    in   butch cassidy and the sundance kid     1969     he was the most dangerous shot in the west   yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good looking charmer    even in   indecent proposal     1993     where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love   redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency   especially when reciting a tale of lost love    in his latest film     the horse whisperer     based on the best selling novel by nicholas evans   redford again plays such a character    redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie   i suppose the character of tom booker   a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses   was just too good to pass up    despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses   a magazine article coins the phrase   horse whisperer   to describe his uncanny talent     booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life    booker s talents are taxed into service by annie maclean   kristin scott thomas     a new york magazine editor whose daughter   grace   scarlett johansson     was recently in a horrible accident    the accident   which is filmed with gut wrenching horror   happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses   an eighteen wheeler kills grace s friend   severely wounds and traumatizes grace s horse   pilgrim   and causes grace to lose part of her right leg    annie believes that if pilgrim can be healed   grace will be healed as well   which leads her to booker    at first   she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse   but that doesn t work    instead   she packs up grace and pilgrim   leaves her husband   robert   sam neill   behind   and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother   frank   chris cooper     and his sister in law   diane   dianne wiest      in many ways   the film is like a journey   both literally and symbolically    the move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal   and it s hard not to see annie and grace s leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs   country    in   the horse whisperer     country is clearly the victor    the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness   and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide open spaces of montana that grace s anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate   annie s controlling nature begins to relax   and pilgrim once again learns to trust people    redford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed   a river runs through it   six years ago    in many ways     the horse whisperer   comes from the same poetic vein as   river     and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera time on the grass and mountains    but then   that would ruin the magic    much of the film s photography is truly elegant   and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land    to further emphasize this   redford and cinematographer robert richardson     natural born killers       platoon     cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film   which takes place in new york   with mostly cold   harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1   85   1 aspect ratio   when the action shifts to montana   richardson switches to soft focus and natural lighting   and the screen widens to a 2   35   1 aspect ratio    in terms of the story itself     the horse whisperer   gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean s   a brief encounter     1945   and clint eastwood s 1995 adaptation of robert james waller s   the bridges of madison county     richard lagravenese   co screenwriter here also adapted   bridges        although   the horse whisperer   has a strong romantic sensibility   i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story    it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who s being left behind for this brief   heart sweeping affair   but there rarely is    in   the horse whisperer     the thankless role of being the fuddy duddy husband falls to sam neill    he plays the character as a decent   hard working man who is a good husband and father   his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him    he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away   but simply because he happens to be a normal   fairly uninspiring man    there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character    it shows booker and robert going into a horse pen   booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all   while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out of place in a baseball cap    as they enter the pen   booker assuredly swings over the fence   while robert hesitates   then opens the gate and   in a goofy moment   forgets to close it behind him    it s a small scene   but it clearly demonstrates the movie s thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness    after all   booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it    the best scenes in   the horse whisperer   tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie   but rather the healing process of grace and her horse    although booker s horse training methods are mythical and unrealistic   the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing    these are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace   some of which are humorous   and all of which are tender and true    at some point   i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more    nevertheless   redford is obviously a romantic at heart   and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film    there are no dramatic sex scenes   but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow dancing   always moving ever closer together   that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together    although the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character   there are enough moments like that which make   the horse whisperer   worth the price of admission    

Pos, in roger michell s romantic comedy notting hill   william thacker   hugh grant   leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it s name to the film s title    one day   american movie superstar anna scott   julia roberts   walks in to purchase a book on turkey    quickly enamored of each other   the two embark upon an on again   off again love affair replete with romance   humor   and the occasional lump in the throat    the film opens with a non verbal cue to anna s stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress s appearances in films and at premieres   coming out of limousines   walking the red carpets and such    without words   this sequence gives us a background to her character    following   however   is a set up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives    i don t know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn t have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film   and which never resurfaces after the movie s beginning   but there it is    if there were ever a clear case for   less is more     this would be it    the film is told nearly first person from william s point of view   as he is in every scene    by nature of this arrangement   we get a very definite sense of what he is all about   and his nice guy personality wins us over easily    in fact   much of notting hill s strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis    a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he s even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey soaked apricots from his refrigerator    or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image    william assures her he wouldn t say a word   then adds     well   i ll probably tell myself now and then   but i d never believe it      great stuff    the downside to spending so much time with william is that we don t get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible    we re constantly exposed to william s thoughts   feelings   actions and desires   but don t actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him    there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest   but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we re not sure what she s been thinking all the times in between    this   combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two   makes this hugh grant s film hands down    he gets the great scenes   look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna     the great lines   and gives an overall wonderful performance    julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress s top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film   ala sandra bullock in a time to kill   along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character s unpredictable behavior    anna doesn t get a lot of our compassion    this romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance   much of it supplied by grant himself   but with considerable help from the supporting cast    most notable is rhys ifans as spike   william s eccentric roommate   who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh    hugh bonneville   emma chambers   james dreyfus   and gina mckee bring up the guard as william s friends and family   particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister s birthday dinner   and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst    it s a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation    roger michell s use of visuals doesn t sweep us off our feet   but does give us more than your typical movie of this type    for example   there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass    whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying   eight months later     michell presents us with more interesting cues   such as william s walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him    another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air    we re generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so   but in this case   the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird s eye view of the ground below    music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film s scenes   and some of this might have been better toned down   but in other areas it works to full effect    it s kind of a mixed bag   but still fares better than many of today s lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video    at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate    notting hill s grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all time greatest film pairings   but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it    for a couple of hours   you should expect to laugh more than cry   and that s not so bad   now is it    

Pos, usually when one is debating who the modern queen of the romantic comedy is they will bring up names like julia roberts or sandra bullock    others will mention meg ryan    but for me   it s not even close    janeane garofalo is not only the queen of the romantic comedy   she is the best comic actress in hollywood right now    and it s a good thing she s starring in the matchmaker   because without her presence the movie would be bland   unfunny   and dull    garofalo stars as marcy tizard   a top aide to boston senator john mcglory   who is suffering in the polls    in an attempt to capture the irish vote   he sends marcy on a mission to a small irish town called ballinagra in search of other mcglory s that never moved to america    unfortunately for marcy   her visit coincides with the town s annual matchmaking festival    things get off to a rocky start for marcy though    she has no hotel reservations   for no rational reason   and the tiny confined room   tired old cliche    she has to stay in has a visitor in her bathtub    his name is sean   and marcy finds him repugnant at first   so you can obviously tell where this is headed    the movie runs into a few roadblocks    for instance   the story is very thin    none of the characters   except the old local matchmaker   are nearly as interesting as garofalo    some of the characters   like the political aide played by denis leary   have wandered in from a completely different movie    i think the director realized this and decided to throw in numerous shots of the beautiful irish scenery   and several close ups of garofalo s winning smile    the strange thing is that it works    garofalo s charm and the irish scenery could carry the thinnest of stories   and it carries this one    

Pos, bob the happy bastard s quickie review    the mummy  brendan fraser s stuck in the past again   but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone        fraser is the lead star of the mummy   the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers   who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising      it s a rough adaptation of the 1932 film   and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages   like boris karloff was engulfed in    but who cares   the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you can t get from   oh   say   godzilla or armageddon    fraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground    basically   it s a little sign from the mummy buried underneath  a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress    his plan  wake back up and wake her up also   making him invincible    of course   fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian   rachel weisz   and her brother   john hanna     along with a former buddy of his   deep rising s kevin j   o connor   and some   americans         and  guess what    yup   ihmoetep   arnold vosloo   awakens and wreaks havoc    fire flies from the sky   flesh eating beetles crawl about   and   well   ihmoetep s plan begins to unfold    ok   so it s not really all that new a story   but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough    the special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch   and the acting from fraser and weisz isn t half bad either    the action is pretty intense   favorite scene   the sandstorm   and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horror loving folks as well    no   it s no phantom menace beater   but if you re looking for a solid warm up to the summer movie season   you won t find a better film under wraps than the mummy    if this doesn t give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man   then nothing will    

Pos, imagine this    you re given a sword and a shield and very basic   minimal training    a man you don t know tells you that this will be the last day that you will live    you are thrown into an arena with thousands of spectators wanting to see you die    you frantically monitor several closed doors which   in seconds   will release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you    you watch as the innocent friends you made in the last few days are murdered in cold blood    if you are lucky enough to survive this chaos thrown at you   you know you re going to have to do it all over again tomorrow    eventually know matter how strong or skilled you are   you re going to die    this is the life of a gladiator    you ll never have to be a gladiator and after seeing ridley scott s powerful gladiator   you ll be thankful for that    with his new film   scott has returned cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire    and like those preceding it   spartacus and ben hur   gladiator has nearly everything going for it   a strong lead actor   a wonderful supporting cast   eye catching special effects   and a great script    since the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator   teenagers to thirty year old males   were around   a whole new genre may just be reborn and revisited    >from a weak beginning   the film starts off extremely gloomy and inauspicious    rome s best general maximus   russell crowe     who has helped the empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted   is currently   in the year 180 a   d   that is   waging a war against germania    scott shoots the gory battle in an awkward style   similar to that of saving private ryan but much less effective    it s blurry   in slow motion   and the sound is muted    as soon as this artistic method began   it was hard to tell what was what and who was who    it s a good thing scott stops this after the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would have been torture to watch    instead   the general swears he will get out after this battle    he wants to go back to his family and his crops   he wants a quiet life    but   unexpectedly   he gets anything but that    the dying emperor of rome   marcus aurelius   richard harris     decides to have maximus appointed new emperor of rome once he dies    he asks maximus to restore the republic by giving more power to the senators    all of this does not go well for aurelius  son   commodus   joaquin phoenix   who was expecting his father to name him the new emperor    jealous and upset   commodus kills his own father   names himself emperor   kills maximus  wife and son   and attempts to kill maximus    but maximus is able to escape his own death and vows to kill commodus and fulfill marcus aurelius  wishes    now a slave   the only way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal is to become a winning gladiator   who eventually are released for their success    a story of betrayal and promises   gladiator is more than just a mindless action flick    you actually care about the characters   sometimes even the evil villain commodus   who is just a young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus is determined to make it the other way    phoenix plays his character brilliantly    think of commodus as the percy wetmore   of pant wetter the green mile   of the roman empire   a whiny   sleazy     respect me because my father was a good man   brat who hates when he s not the center of attention    every scene we see commodus   he s either crying or he looks like he has just been crying    phoenix has definitely matured as an actor since to die for   and gladiator shows he s more than just river s little brother    crowe is also excellent as the film s grisly faced hero    maximus is one of the few characters in recent cinema who actually has emotions    this guy actually acts like a anyone in his situation would act   he s no invincible superhero who only blurts out one liners   he   believe it or not   acts like a human being !  the rest of the cast   including richard harris   djimon hounsou   walter hill   derek jacobi   and connie nielsen are also first rate    ridley scott   using outstanding special effects   has brilliantly recreated the roman coliseum   the loudness of the roman mob   and the city of rome in general    the visuals are breathtaking and voluminous   like a cleopatra of the year 2000    the costuming is also wonderful from the detailed shields and armor to the exquisite dress of the upper class politicians    gladiator is another movie you have to see on the big screen to get the most out of the experience    along with u 571   action fans should have plenty to see in theaters this week and should expect much more excitement to come this summer of 2000    

Pos, note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    james toback s return to directing after a eight year layoff   two girls and a guy   is a film which is comprised   more or less   of just that   one guy   blake   robert downey jr       two girls   carla   heather graham   and lou   natasha gregson wagner     one primary setting   blake s absurdly spacious bachelor apartment     and a great deal of dialogue    embracing a near real time approach   this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr   toback for his bantering characters    fortunately   the film s cast is up to the challenge   and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters   while admittedly variable   are occasionally wickedly amusing    the film s setup is fairly generic in nature   and opens rather unpromisingly    we meet self possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou   both waiting outside a soho loft    as they engage in idle chatter   it is revealed that they re both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport   and it doesn t take long for them to come to the realisation that they re being two timed by the same guy    more indignant with him than catty with each other   the duo break into blake s loft and await his arrival for a confrontation    it s when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride    played with magnificent bombast by mr   downey jr     blake is a cad   all right   but a captivatingly dynamic   blusterous   and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights    it s fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat   and perhaps the film s best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return   allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others   but by his own innate behaviour    whether he s flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi   or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds   carla   lou   and his unseen sickly mother     it s never less than wildly entertaining and insightful    though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one man show    a typical afternoon in the life of blake   if you will    carla   and then lou   reveal themselves   and the sparks begin to fly       one of the great touches in the film is how blake   when startled by carla s unannounced appearance   begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat s out of the bag      double teamed by the understandably aggrieved women   who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful    they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy     an increasingly flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self righteous declarations against their verbal jabs    surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters   two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off limits for this film    however   it d be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou s outrage to full feature length   and it s as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel    the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever   the film s tempo loses its liveliness   the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion   and several sequences fall flat    subtle and not quite subtle allusions are made   a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall     and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale    one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla    two girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter   long running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene    contractually obligated to deliver an r rated film   mr   toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc 17 rating in favour of an r    and while admittedly titillating   the net effect of the vignette on the film s thematic narrative is rather dubious    if anything   two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr   downey jr     whose versatility is put to the test in this film    he plays the gamut from indignant to humbled   from self assured to disconcerted   yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered    it s a wonderful performance in a role custom tailored for him   mr   toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr   downey jr   was arrested on drug charges   and it s hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character    in a monologue to his mirrored reflection   blake s self chiding to   get [his] shit together   is disquieting in its resonance    while mr   downey jr    s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film   both actresses are solid in more broadly observed roles    ms   graham is quickly becoming one of america s more daring actresses   involving herself in three successive risky projects    two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank   while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman    she s quite appealing here   playing a character at once both dainty and sultry    meanwhile   ms   gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying   or   like me   endearing    she tones it down substantially as the film progresses   but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox    the film was reportedly shot in eleven days   filmed mostly in sequence   and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout    two girls and a guy has an agile   spontaneous sort of feel   and one senses that mr   toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors    while the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact   it doesn t feel constricted   the expansive apartment setting is well used to vary the background   and mr   toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner    two girls and a guy falls short of its potential   but thanks to some stellar work by mr   downey jr     it s still often an enjoyable   bitingly funny romp   particularly as we watch the surprisingly resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends       i m an actor     he tells them at one point   using the ol  tried and tested occupational hazard defense       actors lie      but not   they all seem to agree   denzel washington    

Pos, robert altman s cookie s fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good    it is a sunny   delightful   dreamy comedy   filled with lovely performances   skillful direction and topped off with an understated   clever   extraordinary script    as this is an ensemble piece   it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters   all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs    first we meet willie   charles s   dutton     an honest man with a slight drinking habit    we then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie   who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled with loneliness   despair   and want of her dead husband    we cut to camille   glenn close   who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora   julianne moore      then we briefly get acquainted with emma   liv tyler     an apparent relative of cookie   who is a down but not out teen outcast   still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live    we also fleetingly see emma s lover jason   chris o donnell     an ambitious but far too excitable young cop    we are now about one quarter through the two hour picture   and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion    we see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husband    she exclaims   here i come !    and then puts a pillow to her face and shoots herself    soon after   her niece camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl   comes upstairs   finds cookie dead and flips out    convinced that suicide is a disgrace and that she will have none of that in her family   she eats the suicide note and convinces her slightly slow   yet sweet   sister that it was a murder    she makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well   scattering jewelry all over the floor   breaking a few cabinets   windows and doors   and then throwing the gun out in the back yard    the only reasonable suspect is willie   who immediately gets taken into custody   and put in a jail cell   they all know he didn t do it   so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful emma      meanwhile   the unperturbed camille continues her none too subtle manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play a success    so begins cookie s fortune   a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as   a southern spin on fargo     except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers  darker   somewhat disturbing and slightly overrated escapade    robert altman s slight picture is in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well   in that both films focus   on and off   on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us town    indeed   most of the characters in cookie s fortune are loads of fun to observe   and a portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi  dimensional    glenn close turns in an insubstantial   in terms of her career   but magnificent performance as the conniving camille and is also the source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie   and she is perfectly cast as the prolific   aunt alexandria   character   endlessly obsessed with family dignity    the equally essential role of willie is handled with an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s   dutton   mimic   a time to kill    there is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside hours   even days after the film ends    cookie s fortune is such a movie    i loved the light   kindhearted approach altman   whose last project was the dark   intense drama the gingerbread man   took towards the tricky subject matter    i enjoyed the talented ensemble cast    i even liked the trite   in the south everybody is related to everybody   cliche that is inevitably employed by the time this movie draws to a close    i m not sure why cookie s fortune had such an all around pleasing effect on me    perhaps it s that good ol  southern charm    

Pos, what do you get when you combine clueless and dumb and dumber    to answer the question   you get director david mirkin s new comedy romy and michele s high school reunion    romy white   mira sorvino   mighty aprhodite   and michele weinberger   lisa kudrow   tv s friends   have been inseparable buddies since they graduated from sagebrush high in 1987    however   when former classmate heather mooney   janeane garafolo   the truth about cats and dogs   confronts romy about the 10 year reunion   she is astounded that she forgot    watching pretty woman for the um teenth time   they are reminded of how they wouldn t let julia roberts  character shop in the expensive stores because of her appearance    then it hits them   they are not successful    what are she and michele going to do    romy s instant solution is lose some weight off their already slender frames     bag a couple of boyfriends     and get jobs    romy says this will be easy   but michele retorts that if it is so easy   why hadn t they already done it    robin schiff s script keeps the show moving with some nice one liners    one of the best has romy reminiscing about her life s battle against the bathroom scales       i was so lucky getting mono     she says looking at her thinnest high school picture       that was like the best diet ever      the casting for the film is so perfect that one begins to suspect that the leads were chosen and then the script was developed    romy and michele use their high school yearbook to discuss the caste system at their high school    the film s editor david finfer dissolves the stills from the yearbook to live action flashbacks which makes the past come to life    at sagebrush high   the hierarchy consisted of the a group   cheerleaders     the b group   drama club   and the c group   nerds      romy and michele were none of the above    ridiculed as   the weirdoes     they were constant targets for abuse    even though they were quite attractive   they had so much fun being together that they did not care about the others    that they make their own outlandish clothes helped keep the wall around them    complementing romy and michele s lightness   is janeane garofalo as the dark   pudgy heather mooney    heather   who invented a new cigarette paper for cigarettes with   twice the taste in half the time for the gal on the go     has the success and the money that they would like    heather was even more of an outsider than they were in high school    garofalo s one dimensional role is only a side show    this is a two person film with the other characters there merely for the two leads to bounce their lines off of    the genuine chemistry between sorvino and kudrow makes for a sweet and sometimes touching comedy    they have so much fun acting out their parts   their enjoyment spreads to the audience        

Pos, when i initially set out to review this film   my tag line was going to be   you too can believe whales can fly      then it was going to be   you too can believe pastel triangles can fly      then   it was going to be   you too can believe wood sprites can fly      finally   i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say        there s a lot of flying going on in this film !  as our first host steve martin tells us   the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in    well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while   because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released    part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940   grossing somewhere close to $110   000 in its original month of release      subsequent re releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved   and rightfully deserved      to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia   disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before   six stories high    in an exclusive four month engagement   from january 1st to april 30th   2000     fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us    after the engagement is over   the film will be shown at regular theaters    is the format effective for the film    with a few exceptions   yes    the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven s fifth symphony    it s hard to describe exactly what this segment is about   but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily    everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil   black bat like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts    eventually   shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat like things and peace returns to the butterfly things    though this segment isn t very story driven   some of the images are very visually strong   especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things   who are all outlined in blood red colors   begin to overtake the skies    the next segment is set to ottorino respighi s   the pines of rome      in this segment   some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape    a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack    he is finally saved   by another liberating shaft of light   and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the   oceans   of clouds    again   visuals are the key with this segment   especially where the whales are involved    reportedly the whales   as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences   are shown as actual size    the cgi whales look incredibly life like   except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images    one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent    absolutely beautiful stuff    the third segment   and the least of the eight segments   is set to george gershwin s   rhapsody in blue      this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld   and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york    there s a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer   an out of work sad sack that dreams of having a job   a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm   and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife    i won t go into how everything works out   but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending    unfortunately   the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments    segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich s   piano concerto no   2   and is an animated version of hans christian andersen s   the steadfast tin soldier      a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind up clock ballerina   whom he assumes is also one legged because he can t see her other leg extended out behind her     much to the dismay of an evil jack in the box jester    the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina    little does the jester know   the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from    the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl    although the ending has been altered from the andersen story     the steadfast tin soldier   is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short    some children may find the jester to be a little frightening   but otherwise the segment is well made    segment five is the funniest of the bunch    set to camille saint saens   the carnival of the animals     this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number    while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia   it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy    segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia   and it s the one that people remember most     the sorcerer s apprentice      the story is the most recognizable   so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo    unfortunately   the segment wasn t made to be presented on large format film   considering it was shot full frame   and exhibits large amounts of grain    there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain    similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately   but no one seems to notice for some strange reason     an anomaly common to many 18 plus screen theaters    segment seven is set to sir edward elgar s   pomp and circumstance march no   1   and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character    donald duck   stars   as an assistant to noah   whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark    during the loading   donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn t make it on the boat    they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners    despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece   it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear jerkers foisted on audiences these days    powerful stuff    segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich     saving the best for last      set to igor stravinsky s   the firebird     an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape    trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation    when the sprite examines the formation   it awakens and becomes the titular firebird    in a stunning spectacle   the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path   including everything that the sprite has worked to create    some amazing animation is present here   and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone   although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film      the host segments are largely   no pun intended   throwaways   although steve martin s clip is pretty funny    be sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin    penn and teller are usually funny   but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting    the best segment comes from   of all people   bette midler   who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board    pieces like flight of the bumblebee   a take on the four horsemen set to wagner s   ride of the valkyries     and a strange segment prepared in the  40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments    for fans of visual stimulation or classical music   fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon    the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material    as i mentioned earlier in the review   if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film   fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters    i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though    then you too can believe that whales/triangle things/sprites can fly    [g]  

Pos, anastasia contains something that has been lacking from all of the recent disney releases           especially hercules          emotion    all the wacky characters voiced by celebrities and fantastically animated adventure sequences aren t going to hold anyone s interest unless there is an emotional core to hold it all together    not since disney s beauty & the beast has there been such a compelling animated film with interesting characters and drama that works    the story of the romanov family   the rulers of russia   and their downfall begins the film    anastasia   one of the daughters   narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin   voiced by christopher lloyd   with her grandmother   voiced by angela landsbury      but anastasia gets lost   and grows up with no memory of her royal origins    the grandmother lives in paris   hoping to someday find her beloved anastasia   the only member of the family to survive the russian revolution    a young woman named anya   voiced by meg ryan   runs across dimitri   john cusack   and vlad   kelsey grammar     who are trying to put together a scheme to create an anastasia to fool the grandmother and get the reward money    they pick anya to pose as their princes   and of course   it is soon revealed that anya is in fact the lost anastasia    dimitri realizes that he can never win her love as he is a commoner   and meanwhile   rasputin is not dead   and plots his revenge against the last romanov    the plot is actually quite well structured    there are a lot of complexities that may have to be explained to the kids later   but it moves along fast enough that they ll never have time to be bored    what this really means is that the adults won t be bored by it either    there is a great deal of banter between anya and dimitri that is very funny   and their relationship develops quite naturally as the film progresses    there is   of course   lots of comedy for the kids   including rasputin s pet bat   bartok   hank azaria     who is easily the funniest thing in the film    however   the comical scenes never distract from the drama   but are worked into the plot almost seamlessly    the animation is gorgeous   the characters seem to come to life through the talented animators    not since beauty & the beast have animated characters had so much life to them    even without the voices   they act    the musical number in paris is a show stopper   with some of the backgrounds rendered in an impressionist painting style    as with all recent animated features   there are songs   however   these songs do more than just provide fodder for top 40 singers to get on the radio   although there are three of them during the end credits      the songs are all very catchy   and advance the plot   instead of just being showpieces   except for the paris number   but that s so much fun   it s okay            i can t reccomend anastasia highly enough    it s a wonderful film that ranks right up there with other animated classics    kids and adults alike will enjoy it   and it s also nice to have a quality animated feature film from another studio besides disney

Pos, plot   this movie takes place over one day    it s a rookie cop s narcotics training alongside a seasoned police veteran    the rookie doesn t know much about   street justice     so the older cop teaches him about the way things work in the   real world      how even cops like themselves have to   bend the rules   and   break the law   every now and then   in order to catch the really bad guys    critique   a pretty intense little movie with solid acting across the board   some ups   some downs and a thrilling ending   despite a couple of small flaws    i really enjoyed this movie because it followed two extreme characters and put them in situations which had me wondering about what i would do if i were in their place    the film gets right into the   dirty   side of   well       the  dirt on the streets   and proceeds to teach the rookie cop   and us   the audience   how things really work down there    of course   we re receiving this lesson from a man who has put away a lot of scum in his time   but the things he seems to be doing aren t exactly on the up and up either    and therein   lies the fun of the film    do you agree that you yourself would need to break a few small laws in order to put away the people who break the really big ones    well   as the film moves along   we re given two points of view in respect to this predicament   and to me   both sides made sense at some point or another    and you gotta give a lot of credit to the screenplay for that   the director   who builds the film up wonderfully   with the darkness of the day leading to the darkness in the script   and the two actors who deliver their parts in spades    hawke   first off   because he rarely plays these   commercial   roles but does so perfectly here   with a vulnerable side which has you feeling for the bastard right off the top    and denzel   well   what can you say about mr   washington that hasn t already been said before    he comes through as per his usual high level style here   and gives the audience a completely different side to his talent   of which   i personally would like to see more    he s nice   he s not so nice   he s smart   he s not so smart   he s caring and he s a dog all the way    the few problems that i did have with this film included the redundant nature of the whole thing at some point   okay   we get it       you  have to be nasty in order to deal with these nasty people       move on   and this one really major   coincidence   which involved a bathtub   that saved the day for one character   but seemed a little too   convenient   for my taste    i also never really understood how washington s character got out of a certain dire predicament   only to be seen driving his car in the very next scene    but obviously these small flaws didn t taint my overall enjoyment of this tense drama   a film that gets you right into the streets   into the nooks and the crannies   and into the moral dilemma which lies between the justice system and the day to day drug busts    see it if you want to wrestle with some of these issues yourself   see it if you want to see denzel and ethan strike up a palpable chemistry on screen   and see it if you like holding on to your seat handles real tight during a movie    in fact   see it for the scene in which ethan hawke plays cards with a host of gang bangers alone       dang   now that s intense !  where s joblo coming from    the corruptor   7/10     crimson tide   9/10     l   a   confidential   /10     lethal weapon   8/10     requiem for a dream   8/10     seven   10/10     shaft   7/10     traffic   8/10

Neg, best remembered for his understated performance as dr   hannibal lecter in michael mann s forensics thriller   manhunter   scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on    usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock   he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight     he s only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do    if you want to see some brilliant acting   check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach s hidden agenda    cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l   i   e     which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge    big john feels the love that dares not speak its name   but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad    what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light    he s an even tempered   funny   robust old man who actually listens to the kids  problems   as opposed to their parents and friends   both caught up in the high wire act of their own confused lives      he ll have sex for pay with them only after an elaborate courtship   charming them with temptations from the grown up world    l   i   e   stands for long island expressway   which slices through the strip malls and middle class homes of suburbia    filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a   pretty transparent   metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15 year old protagonist   howie   paul franklin dano      in his opening voice over   howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road   citing the l   i   e    highway deaths of filmmaker alan j   pakula   songwriter harry chapin   and his own mother on exit 52    he s both fascinated and disturbed by the l   i   e     and those feelings are projected onto big john   who follows howie around in his bright red car   but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn t want to do    this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies    he s a beast   but ashamed of it      l   i   e   would have worked best as a half hour short film about howie s ill advised foray into big john s haven    there is unnecessary padding with howie s miserable dad   bruce altman   in the hot seat for a white collar crime   degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle class houses   and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise ass gary terrio   billy kay     a handsome artful dodger    rather than add to the themes of suburban ennui   not that we needed another movie on that subject     these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length    concurrently   the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted    cox   sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo   is all bluff and bluster    dano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent    we re so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious   calling haley joel !     it s surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene    the restraint is admirable    but l   i   e    s screenplay doesn t always give them the best material    when howie reads big john a walt whitman poem   the moment feels a bit too precious    director michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john   who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach s goldberg variations    it s too much    there are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john s other boy toy   walter masterson     jealous over the newbie    this plot thread predictably leads to violence    not content to be a haunting   observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world   like terry zwigoff s superb ghost world     cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note    it s typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet   sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex   philosophical note    in this regard   l   i   e       and countless other indie films   share something in common with blockbuster action films   problems are solved when the obstacle is removed    how often does real life work this way    to extend the question   if a movie is striving for realism   do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion    

Neg, forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects    set in 1692 at salem   massachusetts   the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon    they beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells    then one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes    not to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor   daniel day lewis     abigail   winona ryder   suddenly seizes a chicken   beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood    taking even adolescent hormone surges into account   surely this chicken bashing bit is a bit excessive   especially for prim puritan sensibilities    surely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets    the crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller s name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play    this is far from a harmless event   a bad start to an already shaky morality tale    the play describes the film s opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply   and this adds to the play s charged atmosphere    in the film   the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora s box    not only is credulity stretched but abigail s obsession is unfortunately spotlighted    it positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts   it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot    not surprisingly   the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning   witches are invoked by those eager to blame    when the girls are questioned   their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses   led lustfully by abigail    with alarming synchronicity our hormonally advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents   constant reminders that abigail s passion sets all this into inexorable motion    abigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor s love   his wife elizabeth   joan allen     by including her among those accused of witchcraft    appropriately narrow waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile   watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow     day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an over earnestness that longs to be watched    director nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis  foaming mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration    otherwise   hytner s direction is unremarkable    ryder s performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings    her fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful    abigail supposedly revels in her newfound power   but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here    paul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth   but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves    probably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing   allen s elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character    a scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed    unfortunately   when john s audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost    it is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions    his screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message    the result is a clumsy muddle   i felt like the chicken from the opening scene   head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy handed to be wholly believable    when the gallows beckoned   it was sweet release indeed    far from bewitching   the crucible tests the patience    

Neg, i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film    i bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying     it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday   and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach    throw in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof !  we ll have a hit on our hands !    the replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film   a mishmash collage of one dimensional characters   rampant stereotypes of cultures and races   cliched emotional statements of purpose   and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography    the story is loosely based around the pro football players  strike in 1987 and a rag tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels    keanu reeves stars as shane falco   a has been football college player looking for redemption    gene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers    rounding out the cast includes swingers  jon favreau   7 up pitchman orlando jones   gruff owner jack warden   and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters   the drunken welshman   the overweight sumo wrestler   the black convict   the violent cop   and the dumb   dumb cheerleaders    this bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays   gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is   keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field   and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny s    the usual things happen like clockwork    the hero rises from the ashes of failure   the team comes together in unity   the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest   the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap   and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax    it s also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks    howard deutch   who was behind the camera for two of the best films of  80s   pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful   has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes    obviously the problem is that without a good script   any director will fail in the end    sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory   gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds   the rise and fall of gallant heroes   and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life    the replacements offers none of this    

Neg, capsule   where are you tonight   leni rienfenstal    starship troopers is an expensive   hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography    and bad pornography   at that    it is not good cinema   not good storytelling   and not even stupid fun   it s so cynically   calculatedly bone headed that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed    it s one of the worst movies i ve seen in a long time    why am i calling this movie pornography    pornography   in the abstract   is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts    i remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie   where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper   as   a near pornographic eternity      i didn t agree with that assessment   but i could see what was being implied   the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout   do  er   man   do  er !    that sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers    it s * literally * like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk    it tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening    the film takes place in our future   when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesn t appear to have intelligence    to counterattack   humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable   instead of nuke the planet from orbit   which they re clearly capable of   they send down grunts with m 16 rifles    this isn t heinlein   it s a bad wwii movie   one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy   repetitive   and ultimately tiresome       one scene has a journalist on a battlefield   filimg soldiers being slaughtered   and ends with groaning predictability   said cameraman gets skewered   too      the soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic    they do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense    they don t even behave like soldiers in a bad * movie *   and therefore we don t care about them    we hated the tom berenger character in platoon   but he * mattered *   and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate    here   we don t even hate the bugs    what s there to hate    hating them would be like cursing a hurricaine    if there s anything really hateful there   the movie doesn t know how to give it to us    the screenwriter   ed neumeier    perhaps a better appelation would be   screen typist     and director   the increasingly talent impaired paul verhoeven   have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other    one of the subplots concerns a woman pilot who s great at getting out of tight situations   and does it again and again and again    once or twice is fine    by the fifth or sixth time   it s worn out its welcome    there s never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything   or really being tested to show their mettle    also   the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry    if a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp   then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing    but if one human gets cornered   he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip    uh huh    the very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi fascist flavor    i say   quasi    because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action    the gear   the uniforms   etc      the movie doesn t have the nerve   or the brains   to be genuinely fascist   or intelligent about the subject    the bumpers between scenes   which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda    just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison    like the rest of the movie    there s more   i suppose   but it s not worth it    the acting is bland   neither arsenic nor gravy   the music disposable   the camerawork turgid    the heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like a masterpiece    

Neg,    the world on land    it s just too big for me      starring tim roth   pruitt taylor vince   bill nunn   clarence williams iii    rated r    the legend of 1900s is the year s most absurd movie   a rambling   nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast    it stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth   looking wistful as ever   as a guy named        1900    you heard right    his name is   in all actuality   1900    he was born on an ocean liner on 1/1/1900   uh   hence the name     abandoned and adopted by danny   a ship crewman    1900 spends most of his early years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of danny s fear that he might be taken away from him because of   visa matters      well   when 1900 is about 9 or so   he starts wondering all around the ship    one day   he discovers a grand piano    he sits down and starts playing    miraculously   what comes out is beautiful    a group of onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age    when one of the people who knows 1900 tells him that his playing the piano like that without permission is   totally against regulations   1900 replies   f * ck the regulations !    ho ho ho    1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land    when he s about 30ish and can play the piano like nobody s business   onboard comes another musician    his name is max   pruitt taylor vince   and he plays the trumpet    after 1900 catches max barfing everywhere during a storm   he sits him down on the piano next to him   takes the piano s braces off and plays while the piano flies all around the hall   taking them with it    how the chair they re sitting on and the piano don t separate   i don t know   but this apparently isn t the kind of thing we re supposed to ask    after that   1900 and max become friends    max is determined to get 1900 off the ship and discover what he is missing on land   but 1900 has no intention of doing so    what s more   he doesn t even want his music to go anywhere without him   when a record company hears about his talents   they come on board to make a record of his music   but after finding out that    gasp !     they re going to make millions of copies   he breaks the record    the conflict of the movie is that after max   unsuccessful in his endeavor to get 1900 off the ship   gets off himself   he stumbles upon a record of 1900 s music in a store    the record shouldn t exist because a   1900 never stepped on dry land and b   the one record that was made on the ship was broken    ladies and gentlemen   it s a mystery !  the story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements    we re supposed to be roused by a climactic        piano duel    there isn t anything in this movie with the potential to compel    1900 comes off as a whiny   brooding   extremely unlikable man   i can t recall a single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo  meditation on life    ditto for max   who doesn t seem to have a life outside his friendship with 1900    tim roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as a fig leaf   there s no spirit   no gusto to the character    he insists that he leads a happy life on the ship   but to us he is dead    pruitt taylor vince is a little more palatable   at least providing a moment of comic relief here and there to liven things up a bit    the highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant   leering   king of jazz   who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel    the legend of 1900 was made by giuseppe tornatore   whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many    this effort is utterly limp and lifeless    at once ridiculous   boring   narrow sighted and pointless   this is one movie that should be    and will be    quickly forgotten    

Neg, supposedly based on a true story in which the british drive to build a rail bridge deep in africa grinds to a halt after a pair of lions start killing off the workers in 1898    john patterson   val kilmer     the bridge building expert set to oversee the operation   tried to rid his operation of the lions   but fails    a world renound hunter   remington   michael douglas     is called in and the battle   man against lion   begins    this film has a great soundtrack   and wonderful scenery    the acting is not too bad except the characters are all so thin    we only see one side of each character    kilmer is a bridge builder and that s all we see him as    these lions kill dozens of his men and he doesn t even appear to be too upset about it    and the plot    it s jaws   but with lions    again we re presented with an animal that behaves not at all as it should    it appears to kill men because it just likes too    why    who knows    i guess there wouldn t be much of a story if it didn t    the problem is that there isn t much of a story even though it does    

Neg, it rocks actually   lots of rocks fly at us or from us   in slow or fast motion   at several points in the film    they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward   and when they land once in a while   when we need a break from the space sequences they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like       nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur      they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon   a steroid user s answer to deep impact    bruce willis stars as harry stamper   a famed oil driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond   zero barrier   and destroys our planet    why an oil driller    they require someone experience with deep core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid       in one unintentionally        hilarious sequence   nasa asks harry to inspect a deep core driller they built based on his blueprints   it is poorly constructed harry criticizes almost every aspect of it    we trust nasa to build space shuttles      harry assembles the obligatory   ragtag   bunch of   cowboys     including a blond guy   a fat guy   a black guy   a wiseass   and the man who is sleeping with his daughter   affleck      once they reach space   we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it   i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes    whether or not they save the day   i will not reveal    nor will you care    i will say this   you know you re in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope    willis has barely a chance to come alive   ditto for affleck    their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act   in a last minute and futile attempt to inject warmth into the material    steve buscemi s character the wiseass is exceptionally problematic       rockhound     as he s called   is sarcastic and foolish   so they tape him to a chair   where he spends most of the film    so why did they bring him up there to begin with    rather   why write him into the film    give  his almost witty one liners to serious willis   who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies   at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter   firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig    i m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel   at least in my world where the sky is blue    liv tyler is pretty and humourless   as always   suspiciously   four of her father s band s     aerosmith     songs grace the soundtrack    director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick   like ketchup   eventually drowning the movie on screen       the middle hour is a non sensical   pyrotechnic assault on the average primate s brain      whenever someone dies in this movie   a crew member inevitably yells out   we lost   insert dead person s last name here   !    i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil guy cum astronaut from a live one   and close ups of the corpses  faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance   as their skin was often covered in fake blood    armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla    it looks nicer   and has fewer plot holes within its equally ludicrous framework    it has a vivid soundmix    but at almost two and a half hours   i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story    the love story has been played up in the ads   perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic fever    bollocks !  the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon crawler    remember a little film called jaws    in this film   three independent minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark    they didn t much like each other at first   eventually   they started to respect one another    one of jaws  great scenes involved the would be ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories    this is the sort of male bonding foreign to bay or his producer   jerry bruckheimer   who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we ll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end    not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances i d be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before   action   was called    a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don t bare their souls   who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest beating bravery    to this   i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic   nor brave   nor smart   even   this team couldn t build a birdhouse    and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer a trailer for a movie written by a team of body builders and greeting card authors i ve never been a prouder wimp my whole life    

Neg, it s now the anniversary of the slayings of julie james    jennifer love hewitt   best friends    still besieged by nightmarish memories of the man responsible for it all   she seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown    she can t concentrate on her schoolwork   can t get a good night s sleep   and is even frightened by the shadows and the blinking strobe lights at a local dance club    everywhere she looks   she sees visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his hand    in the first movie   `i know what you did last summer    julie and three of her friends accidentally kill a man   running him down while driving down a dark mountain highway    to cover their misdeed   they dump the body into the ocean    however   he never quite died and returned to hunt down julie and her friends    julie and one other   ray   freddie prinze jr       survived only to make this dismal sequal    needing some desparate rest and relaxation   she is elated to learn that her college roommate   karla   brandy     has won a trip for four to a secluded tropical island    accompanying these two girls are karla s overbearing boyfriend   tyrell   mehki phifer   and a potential beau for julie    but was this contest too good to be true    the resort is filled with a skeleton staff that seemed like love boat rejects    meanwhile   the hotel is practically deserted as the storm season is about to begin    this presumably creates a venue where they will be secluded and will have no possible means off the island    eventually   they will be hunted down during power outages and chased around during intense lightning storms    as you might have guessed   somewhere in the shadows lurk a mysteriously strange figure that is wearing a rubber slicker and wielding a hook    julie tries to convince her friends that the killer is on the island   an eerie touch is when she is singing   i will survive   at the karaoke bar and the words scroll   i still know             but her friends chalk it up to paranoia    but the body count soon starts to rise   and for julie   it s going to be the worst vacation of her life    the funny   yes   i used the word  funny    thing about this movie is that i heard more chortling and giggling   maybe it was my giggling   than i heard screaming    this movie boils down to a mindless slashfest that never conjures up any amount of wry wit or even a quirky campiness    there isn t even any suspense that leads up to the deaths    here s an appropriate example    knock knock       housekeeping     says the diminuitive cleaning lady    the door suddenly opens up    slash    next victim !  is there any reason to go and see this movie    not unless you want to see four uninteresting college kids run around in circles for about 90 minutes    but i do want to say one thing about this movie that satisfied me    i was thoroughly irritated with tyrell   who incessantly ranted and raved about his sexual libido    i secretly wished for him to get filleted    did he get  hooked     well   let s just say that if he didn t   i would give this film a grade of   d      

Neg, a documentary from the twin hughes brothers   allen and albert   dead presidents   menace ii society     about street pimps   all of whom are african american    an offscreen interviewer questions them about their lives and profession    it is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their ho s   and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be   is what you get    i learned that the word   bitch   is their favorite word   as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used    it makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say   but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about   then some of what they rap about might seem amusing    they seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen   in the business because it is the easiest way for them to make big money    it s also a power trip   accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them   mostly by humiliating them and keeping them in place    this sleazy pic   soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears    these verbose pimps had a smart answer for everything and never knew when to shut their face    the hughes brothers used as their pimp role models   the feather hatted   fur coated   diamond ring wearing   gold chain wearing   flashy cadillac cruising pimp of the late  70s blaxploitation movies  like the mack and willie dynamite    also used as reference   was iceberg slim s best seller pimp   the story of my life    we meet pimps such as   fillmore slim   c note   charm   k red   gorgeous dre   bishop don magic juan   and rosebudd    they readily discuss their business arrangements   including percentages   lifestyles   knockin   stealing another pimp s ho     and the thrill they get from women giving them money    these dudes needed no prompting to talk   as they just love to brag about about themselves       priests need nuns      yaps c note   a san francisco pimp       doctors need nurses    so ho s need pimps       as he tries to persuasively make the same case all the other pimps in the film make   that the girls need them to show them the ropes   how to make money   to be their security blankets   protectors   and counselors    the race issue was brought up right from the film s onset   as a number of white interviewees   regular citizens   note that their impression of a pimp   is that he s the lowest form of human    while   we are told   in the black community   the pimp is looked upon as a successful entrepenaur   riding around in fancy cars   flashing wads of money   dressed in a flamboyant style   where his snake gaiter shoes might cost him a grand   and where he boasts hollywood style status in the community    we also see that the black pimps have a number of white girls in their stable and we see how they treat them like dirt   as the film implies that this could be payback for the days of slavery   of master and slave relations    the film was all about pimp style and their projected image   as they run a hard sell riff about the virtues of their work    there are different styles of pimping   but the film mentions them only as being   macks   and   players   or   real pimps   and   perpetrator pimps     but no further clarity is attempted    it is also failed to get the women s side to this story of abuse   primarily taking the pimp at his word    the film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such a perverted way as he does   as the filmmakers were taking for a ride by the pimps   who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing   hungry for their 15 minutes of fame    the only laughs i got out of this bleak look at an american subculture   was hearing how a few pimps retired and what they are now up to    danny brown became a blues singer so he could keep his pimp s wardrobe    while a hollywood pimp called rosebudd   married his ho and turned square   working to support his wife and daughter as a telemarketer    

Neg, whether you like the beatles or not   nobody wants to see the bee gee s take on some of the fab four s best known songs    well   maybe that s not true            maybe you re curious   the way you have to look in your hanky after you blow your nose    you just have to know how bad bad can be    if that s the case   rejoice   because it was twenty years ago today   or so   that sgt    pepper s lonely hearts club band was released   unleashed     to the world   and thanks to our modern technological advances   you can find this retched piece of filmmaking on vhs    derived from the lyrics of various beatles  songs   sgt    pepper s tells the story of the fictitious band made popular from the song   and album   of the same name   released in 1967    of course   the movie was made eleven years later   the gibbs three have become the lonely hearts   peter frampton is the one and only billy shears   and aside from being about a rock band   the story doesn t correlate to the song at all    and oh   what joy   we re the lovely audience they d like to take home with them    i don t think so    but at least these characters are actually * people * in a beatles  song   whereas other characters such as strawberry fields   sandy farina   gets her name from a song about a * place * called strawberry fields    the debate over this is really quite futile when it comes down to it   because all the film really has to offer is a feast of horrid cover tunes   embarrassing cameo appearances   george burns   !  steve martin   !    alice cooper   !   !     and uuuuuuggggggglllllllyyyyy 70 s fashion and faces    check please !  the plot is a bit unclear    people with bad 70 s hair run around in leisure suits engaging in music video sequences that look like a sick and twisted world of make believe from an overly demented mr   rogers    mean mr   mustard   frankie howerd   somehow gets hold of all billy & co    s instruments   calling dr   maxwell edison   steve martin with a silver hammer and an out of key singing voice     the sun king   marvin sunk   alice cooper !     and a couple of creepy robots to his aid    supposedly this is a horrible thing    i guess in heartland   the talent is pretty non existent    meanwhile   the lonely hearts are off doing the classic   sex   drugs   and rock n  roll   thing   leaving poor strawberry fields without her true love   billy    she sets out to find him   leaving her poor dad and mom   mrs    fields !  hey   wanna cookie      all alone to sing a horrible rendition of   she s leaving home     accompanied by those same creepy robots    but is billy getting it on with lucy   dianne steinberg      ya know   the diamond possessing girl who hangs out in the sky    well   there s some crazy chick singing soprano on the roof of a building next to a bus stop   and i assume that s who it was    it s movies like this that make ya sit back and ask the unanswerable question     what the hell were they thinking          nobody will ever know   but as a novelty   sgt    pepper s is one to examine    carol channing   robert palmer   keith carradine   they re all here    but why          who knows    it s irrelevant    there s as much meaning to be found here as there is to be found in your belly button lint   although the latter may be more interesting    with the recent onslaught of 70 s nostalgia in the movie world   the ice storm   boogie nights   reissues of the star wars trilogy   etc       let s pray this doesn t get a special 20th anniversary   second chance in theaters    in the words of paul mccartney   live and let die    in fact   bury this one while you still can    

Neg,    showgirls   is the first big budget   big studio film to receive an nc 17 rating    and its release last year came at a time when senator bob dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence    but if   showgirls   is any indication of hollywood s future   the folks in washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to american values  bad moviemaking       showgirls   is a relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene   and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter    director paul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas   who collaborated on another shock value project   1992 s   basic instinct     follow the plight of a young woman   teen tv star elizabeth berkley   determined to make a name for herself as a topless dancer    it s a hackneyed premise to begin with   so not surprisingly   all of the stock characters are trucked out    there s the demanding producer    the loyal friend    the bitchy competitor    lest i forget the scummy club owner    of course   any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the film s main attraction  an endless parade of full frontal nudity    unfortunately     showgirls   doesn t satisfy in this department    verhoeven s slam bang   in your face style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic    to make matters worse   you ll be forced to sit through the movie s clothed scenes   which don t cover up for laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history    verhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground   but if it s adult entertainment you want   stay home and watch the playboy channel    you ll be the wiser for it    

Neg, deceiver is a plot twist in search of a movie    this overly constructed film succeeds in having many surprises   and   being true to its title   being deceptive    but there is little in the film that is worthy of deceit    braxton   chris penn   and kennesaw   michael rooker   are two cops investigating the brutal murder of a prostitute   renee zellweger      their lone suspect is wayland   tim roth     a wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hooker s pocket    however   a routine lie detector test turns against the investigators   as the crafty wayland somehow turns the tables    braxton and kennesaw are forced to confront their own troubled lives    braxton is a gambling addict in deep to mook   ellen burstyn     a local bookie    kennesaw is bitter about his marriage to a socialite   rosanna arquette     believing his wife to be unfaithful    the plot is twisty and complex   with lots of lengthy flashbacks   and plenty of surprises    however   there are times when it is needlessly complex   and at least one instance the storytelling turns so muddled that the answers to important plot points actually get lost    take a look at l   a   confidential   or the film s more likely inspiration   the usual suspects for how a complex plot can properly be handled    the dialogue in deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot    for example   the film tells a few substories   such as the tale of a woeful absinthe bender   or an alternative telling of how van gogh lost his ear     but they are so flat and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated and unbelievable    there s never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation    they appear to be nothing more than words on a screenplay    the characters   themselves   are rather pathetic and despicable    not one of them is an ounce sympathetic   and as a result   the labyrinthine plot is all for naught    what does it matter who is guilty of what and why    writer directors josh and jonas pate seem to desire to emulate the coen brothers  masterwork blood simple   or the wachowski brothers  less worthy bound    but   while they have got the plot twists down cold   they need to work on characterization and dialogue

Neg,    the animal   is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along   generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling    it s clunky and slow   like watching an 18 wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill    there are certainly better things you can do with your time    actually   if you ve seen the trailer   then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments    the story centers on bland marvin   rob schneider     who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer    but he s afflicted with loser itis    dogs attack him   neighbors torment him   children bully him   and his co workers ignore him    truthfully   with his bad haircut   seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic   little richard   and giant poodles   and his unenthusiastic demeanor   we d probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun    this is actually bad because you can t like a character if you can t develop sympathy for him    we never do   and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and plummets to the canyon floor    however   marvin is found by an eccentric doctor   michael caton   who uses a radical and experimental procedure to save him   implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs    as a result   marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed    he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body   swim with the speed of a dolphin   and can run as fast as a cheetah    imagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation    with his enhanced abilities   he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him    however   the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn   and instead   marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic   sexual urges    goats beware !  he also chases cats   urinates to mark his territory   or growls at his enemies    what he should ve done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich    equally tenuous is its other running joke   which involves one of his friends   guy torry   who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he s black       it s reverse racism     he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything    this element doesn t work the first time it s mentioned   and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence    you don t have to be as wise as an owl to realize that   the animal   is tame    if there s any reason to see this film   it s to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut    remember her    she was voted off in week 11 of the 13 week program     survivor      here   she plays marvin s sunny love interest    while her role required very little actual acting   she seemed very comfortable   even when marvin licks the side of her face like a lapping dog       yuck !      with her adorable disposition   radiant smile   and playful innocence   she could be a meg ryan in the making    it s too bad that she s in such a mediocre offering  

Neg, capsule   the much anticipated re adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting   but very little intelligence    visually there is much to like about this version   but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver s travels and treat it as an action film    that makes it a film without much center       0    4 to +4    pierre boulle   author of the bridge on the river kwai   wrote planet of the apes   a   k   a   monkey planet     the novel   as a social satire    it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver s travels    humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed   not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift s island of the houyhnhnms    the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet    it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals   but perhaps i was just looking for that    when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968   he added a number of serling touches   familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling ish    the final irony of the original version has become film history    without it there could never have been a   planet of the apes   film series    i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language    in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language    that could have been done in the film   but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non ape speaking    serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and   of course   there is some justification for that by the end of the film    justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending    but serling never tackles the all important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language   a language they had no opportunity to ever hear    few viewers questioned this serious plot hole   however   and the film has become well respected in cinema history    partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith s best if not his best    when the film s success called for sequels   the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well intentioned   though not very subtle   political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s    while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half  hearted   by the second film   beneath the planet of the apes   there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases    the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973    now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again    for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book   burton s new version is even less faithful    first   he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes    he has them both be intelligent   articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands   uh   make that paws   of the apes    that could be a good story too   but it is not planet of the apes    as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century   the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring    in 2029 leo davidson   mark wahlberg   not this world s most expressive actor   works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes    then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard of oz fashion and drops him on an alien planet       yes   he survives this storm   but then no storm is perfect      he quickly finds   not greatly to any surprise he shows   that on this planet apes rule and humans drool   but everybody talks    and the language they talk is earth  english    apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that    the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn t occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film    both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english    in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human animal relationships and more one of the master slave relationships    outside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic    leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari   played by helena bonham carter    ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power    she is bent on making the world a better place    perhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil ari    in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout   carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film    she may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward    it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes    this is a further abandonment of the source material    the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each s place in this reversed society   each important in the book    we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down    we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them    burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn    this is a miscalculation   as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in    they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win    the 1968 script had little subtlety   with lines like   i never met an ape i didn t like     but at least we cared for what happened to taylor   the main character    most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals    the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog    this tends to limit close looks at the makeup    in general it seems much improved from 1968    the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers   who did it for the 1968 version    in 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw dropper    it was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion    chambers is good   but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker    today audiences have higher expectations   baker s visualization is really an improvement    these visuals work nicely    what does not work is the wire  assisted leaps some of the apes make    they look like they were inspired by the physics  defying leaps of crouching tiger   hidden dragon    apes spring incredible distances    some of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture   but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost    one final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close up    since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make up    the one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti    it is not that his lines are so good   most are silly jokes    but he delivers them very well    he was always a watchable actor   but has not yet made stardom    as the ape trader limbo he over emotes to overcome his ape make up   but does it very well    in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen    he is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov s performance in spartacus    as an in joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself    danny elfman s score has a nice primitive feel   but jerry goldsmith s 1968 tour de force score is a real classic    that score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten    i rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the  4 to +4 scale    

Neg, the second serial killer thriller of the month is just awful    oh   it starts deceptively okay   with a handful of intriguing characters and some solid location work    after a baby sitter gets gutted in the suit  ably spooky someone s in the house prologue   parallel stories unfold   the first involving a texas sheriff   r   lee emery     a gruesome double murder   and the arrival of a morose fbi agent   dennis quaid   on the eve of voting for the local lawman s reelection    the second pairs a hitch  hiker   jared leto   with a friendly former railroad worker   danny glover      they re headed west   toward the rockies and away from the murder scene    which one is the killer    well   it doesn t really matter    cause when writer/first time director jeb stuart   die hard   finally spills the beans   you won t take his choice seriously anyway    the whole thing goes south about an hour in   with the tale taking hairpin turns that i certainly couldn t follow    and through the whole thing there s quaid   playing with the most intense monotony this side of steven sea  gal    i guess i m glad that i didn t walk out   there s some nice train stuff at the end and a fun nod to dr    strangelove    

Neg, for   original sin     the road to the screen has been rocky    initially slated for release last november   the film was bumped twice   finally landing in the dog days of summer 2001    advance screenings of the film were denied to all but a few critics   generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its hands    so is   original sin   really all that bad    yes it is   but the melodrama does offer some rewards    the location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of t&a   with angelina jolie providing the   t   and antonio banderas the   a        more importantly   the movie is entertainingly bad    veteran readers know that   as a rule   i don t encourage people to patronize lousy films    most of the time   there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides   the   let s go laugh at the failings of others   mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable    but things are different this summer    quality films   to put it mildly   have been few and far between   so as far as i m concerned   it s fair to find our kicks where we may       original sin   will never join such treasures as   valley of the dolls       road house   and   showgirls   in the bad movie hall of fame   but it ll do until something worse comes along    the film   adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel     waltz into darkness     which was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film     mississippi mermaid       opens in a turn of the century prison   as jolie s character   slated for a dawn execution   tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny    the freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like     this is not a love story   it is a story about love      wary of local gold diggers   cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas   banderas   makes arrangements to secure a mail order bride from america   listing himself as a mere clerk to dissuade foreign gold diggers    a practical man   luis chooses a frumpy looking lady   hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him with children    imagine his surprise when his fianc   e   julia russell   jolie     turns out to be infinitely more attractive than the woman in the photo    julia explains that she sent a different woman s image because she didn t want to be selected solely for her pretty face    luis then confesses his deception   leading julie to state   with great significance     we have something in common   we are both not to trusted      after their wedding   luis and julia retire for a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking   with their bodies positioned to display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible    jolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun   although the filmmakers  insistence on using one of banderas  legs to cover jolie s crotch makes it look like he s trying to climb her    luis   the stupidest man who ever lived   immediately instructs the bank to make his personal and business accounts available to julia   despite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he corresponded    his blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up    luis must force julia to write to her sister emily   who is frantic over her lack of communication    shortly after julia complains about the chirping of a pet bird   it is found on the floor of its cage with a broken neck    finally   when she cleans out his accounts and disappears   luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong    incidentally   if you re afraid i m giving too much away   rest assured that all of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie   leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists   a great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass    along the way   private detective walter downs   played by thomas jane   who was terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie   61 *     turns up   hired by the frumpy woman s sister to find out what happened to the real julia    luis is also eager for the detective to track down the con artist   having decided that if he can t have her   he will kill her    oh   the pathos of it all    the cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story   adjusting their performances accordingly    banderas is suitably impassioned   while jolie alternates between vamping and pouting   and with those lips   she can really pout      as for thomas jane   he starts off acting suspicious and cagey   then accelerates to a snidely whiplash level of nastiness    his most startling moment comes when   to prove his power to humiliate   he forces luis against a wall   verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against those of luis and then finishes establishing his dominance with a full on kiss    if anyone ever questions the difference between sex and rape   show them this chilling scene    and if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and a laughable potboiler   show them   original sin      

Neg, capsule   not as bad a sequel as crow 2 or batman & robin   but still horribly putrid   cheesy and ill conceived    this one belongs in saturday morning cartoons        extended review   you know   about halfway through this movie   i realized that if you hacked out everything except the fight scenes   you d have a damn fine 35 minutes or so of flashy   hong kong style martial arts    beautifully choreographed by robin shou   who also plays liu kang   the fight scenes are both mind blowing and graceful   acrobatic enough to make olympic gymnasts weep    this is what made the original so fun   but unfortunately for the sequel   we are without the frenetic directorial style of paul anderson    instead   they got john r   leonetti   the cinematographer for the original mortal kombat    not a good choice    while the fight scenes are brutal and eye popping   the rest of the movie looks like standard made for tv fare    the acting is sub par   which i could endure if it were not for a     the director s style   b     the special effects   & c     the treatment of the story and characters    a     mr   leonetti should go back to lighting   in my opinion    i could say dozens of bad things about him   he way overuses slow motion   he has no eye for action   he can t get even mediocre performances out of actors   and so on    but by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping    apparantly   everybody can now fly    hell   i m all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick and whatnot   but not when it happens every few minutes   and is done so poorly    better jumping and acrobatics has been seen in xena   warrior princess    in short   they should have gotten paul anderson back    or at least let robin shou direct        b     unlike the first one   whose sfx were vibrant and somewhat realistic   mk   a s special effects are bland   fake looking   and overall just plain bad    i counted at least half a dozen times that blue screening was painfully obvious    had this movie been made in the 80 s   it would have been ground breaking    but in today s industry   it doesn t even look finished    c     now for the  really  bad parts    i admit   i m an avid fan of the mortal kombat series    the games are amusing diversions   an easy way to work off stress and anger    the first movie was a mindlessly fun thrillride    this could have been a really cool movie    it isn t    the writers apparantly deemed it necessary to lower the target audience from teens to preschoolers    some of the plot elements are just plain stupid    how stupid    take   for instance   how our heroes move around    they use giants spheres the roll around underground   supposedly at thousands of miles per hour       oh  boy        even worse is the treatment of secondary characters    blink and you ll miss  em    most characters had more depth in the video games    if you thought batman & robin was bad about this   you ain t seen nothin  yet    a good 75% of the characters are introduced   kick somebody around a bit   then either die or are forgotten about    there s no explanation at all for this    and for the final blasphemy   the fight that all the fans were waiting rabidly for   the fight hyped to be the most intricate of the movie   lasted about 3 minutes and then just sort of       ended    it almost made me weep    to sum it all up   rent it on video   and fast forward through everything except the fight scenes

Neg, it s probably inevitable that the popular virtual reality genre     the matrix       existenz     would collide with the even more popular serial killer genre     kiss the girls       se7en        the result should have been more interesting than   the cell      as the movie opens   therapist catharine deane   jennifer lopez   treats a catatonic boy   colton james   by entering his mind through some sort of virtual reality technique that s never fully explained    after months of therapy sessions in a surreal desert   catharine has no success to report    meanwhile   killer carl stargher   vincent d onofrio   has claimed another victim    his particular hobby is to kidnap young women   keep them in a glass cell overnight   and drown them    he takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach   then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching a video tape of the drowning    although carl s been doing this for awhile   he s recently become sloppy   and fbi agent peter novak   vince vaughn   is closing in fast    not fast enough   though   to keep carl from sticking another woman   tara subkoff   in the cell or to catch him before he suffers a schizophrenic attack that leaves him in a coma    from the videos in carl s house   peter can see that the drowning cell is automated and will fill with water forty hours after the abduction    to save the kidnapped girl   peter has to find the cell before the end of the day   and comatose carl s not talking    so off they go to catharine in the hope that she can go inside carl s mind and find out where the cell is in time    the focus of   the cell   in on the ornate interior of carl s mind   but the universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise in computer generated spectacle than an exploration of the psychotic personality    for the most part   it s style without substance    in his own mind   carl is a decadent emperor in flowing robes   ming the merciless   as well as a frightened boy   jake thomas   abused by his father    all in all   the mind of a psycho killer turns out to be a strangely dull place   and i kept wishing i could fast forward to the next development    singh is best known for directing music videos   particularly rem s   losing my religion     and   the cell   seems very much like a really long   really slow mtv video with the sound deleted    singer lopez seems to think she s in a video as well   she devotes more time to posing in elaborate costumes than she does to acting    the premise had great promise    the computer generated world within carl s mind could have been a bizarre   surreal universe governed by insanity and symbolism rather than logic    the first room catharine enters in carl s head shows this promise    she finds a horse standing in center of the room   suddenly   sheets of sharp edged glass fall into the horse   dividing it into segments    the panes of glass separate   pulling apart the pieces of the still living horse    this scene is twisted   disturbing   and thought provoking   because the psychological importance of the horse and its fate is left to the viewer to ponder    another element that should have been developed is the effect on catharine of merging with the mind of a psychopath    their minds begin to bleed together at one point in the movie   and this should have provided an opportunity to discover the dark corners of catharine s own psyche    like sidney lumet s   the offence   or michael mann s   manhunter       the cell   could have explored how the madness of the killer brings out a repressed darkness in the investigator    however   catharine s character is hardly developed at all   and lopez has no depth to offer the role    bottom line   don t get trapped in this one    

Neg, plot   token director alan smithee steals the only copy of his film   trio   from the studio   after they complete the   final cut   without him    he threatens to burn the film reel if they do not allow him to keep his vision    critique   wow    i really can t remember the last time a movie sucked on so many levels !  the   comedy   in this film is pathetic   obvious and dated   oj simpson jokes galore      the plot is uninteresting   boring and bad    the structure of the film is annoying   repetitive and pretentious    the acting is pretty bad   especially jackie chan   who can t act to save his life    the cameos are lame and seem forced   and the ending blows chunks    all in all   this movie believes itself to be a clever   humorous and edgy look behind the closed doors of hollywood   but comes across as a boring   stupid and completely unentertaining piece of shite    i love to see movies about hollywood shenanigans   but this one bites the big one    see it if you like to watch really bad movies   otherwise skip it   because it will just have you hating every star that makes an appearance in it    luckily for us all   this mess only lasts about 80 minutes   and miramax honcho harvey weinstein plays a lead faced detective    by the way   is there any reason why the studio or the producer couldn t have cut another version of the film by the way of all the filmed stock that was left over    who knows   who cares   this   satire   sucks the bag    little known facts about this film and its stars   ironically   the original director of this film   arthur hiller   also requested his name be taken off the credits and replaced by the dga s alan smithee moniker    this was after the film s production company   cinergi pictures   preferred the cut made by producer/writer joe eszterhas to his    the original script of this film included arnold schwarzenegger and bruce willis    eszterhas announced through the media during post production that cinergi pictures didn t have the money to pay for soundtrack    he said that he would finance the soundtrack from his own money and asked to submit tracks for it to him    he received 9   200 cds and cassettes from mostly unknown and unsigned artists   listened to all that was sent   at least a couple of tracks from each record   and compiled the soundtrack    this film practically swept the   razzie awards   in 1999   given out to the worst of all movie categories of the year   with no less than the   worst picture   award   the   worst screenplay     joe eszterhas     the   worst supporting actor     joe eszterhas     the   worst new star     joe eszterhas tied with jerry springer   and the   worst original song       i wanna be mike ovitz !    as written by joe eszterhas      

Neg, not a great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie    earlier this year   nora ephron wrote and produced one of the year s least likeable   comedies   called hanging up   featuring a bunch of annoying women   ironically   lisa kudrow played one in that film as well   who barely have time to care about anyone but themselves    ick       real  sweet stuff    but her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what john travolta went through earlier this summer   with a film entitled battlefield earth    i seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film   even if it was on a   cheese   factor   as everybody   and i mean everybody else   pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst disasters of all time    yipes       another  beauty    so what happens when you put these two people in the same room and come out with a movie co starring the ever versatile lisa kudrow    uhhhm   you guessed it       not  much    plot   in order to escape major financial difficulties   a local weatherman hooks up with his ball picking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery    but as more and more people find out about their scheme   more and more people demand a part of their winnings   and more and more problems arise    critique   simply stated   i didn t laugh once during this entire picture    for a comedy   it offered me a few smiles   a bunch of nincompoops as characters   a miscast john travolta hamming it up and lisa kudrow   in what can only described as a   sluttier   version of her character of phoebe on tv s   friends      this film was not as disastrous as i thought it would be   but it was pretty close    thankfully   the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits   dancing as the weatherman were left in the film s trailer   and not in this final cut    and not unlike the worst movie of the year so far   beautiful   this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic   idiotic and just plain irritating characters in its cast    foremost was travolta s character   who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movie    and for me   the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong    he didn t fit the part    i just saw him in get shorty the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role    a cool   calculating roughneck with a certain hip   suave   je ne sais quoi      in this film   he looks like he s trying to be funny   trying to be bad   trying to be good    we re not supposed to be able to notice that   and when we do   at least in my case   i consider it a wrong choice in casting    add that to lisa kudrow   boring us with yet another one of her patented   dumb blonde   routines   but this time   dressed in sexier outfits    michael rapaport   stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who isn t quite up at the same speed level as everyone else    and a truckload of empty comedic bullet shells   and you ve got yourself an extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize    the only real good thing that i could say about this film is that its story was actually half interesting and never really bored me    i also liked michael moore s perverted cousin character   and i loved   and i say it again   loved the character that bill pullman played    give this dude his own movie !  he played a lazy cop   a man who tries everything not to do any real work    he fakes injuries to get off duty   tries to avoid arrest situations so that he won t have to fill out any forms       now  there s a base of humor    sadly   the filmmakers decided to bring him into play with only about half an hour left in the film    and there s not much else i can say about this movie   folks    on the whole   it was lame   included a slew of unlikable characters fiddling around in a pool of unfunny lines   and very little of interest for any target audience    but get somebody to write up a movie featuring that lazy cop played by pullman and i m there !  

Neg, a sensuous romantic comedy   about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom    there is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out   its the kind of stuff i ve seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny    the film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen   lope cruz   who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations   the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot   but who can t get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story    pen   lope was wonderful in pedro almod   var s   all about my mother     but here she is so visible in such a stale story   where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking   that she somehow looks ridiculous   as if she got egg all over her face    the best you can say about her   is that she s not to blame for this picture being so off    this exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex   is in my opinion   worst than a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will    the story is all about the love   motion sickness   and cooking ability of isabella   cruz     who is born in bahia   brazil and learns to cook at an early age from her parents  cook    to cure her motion sickness   her parents tried every remedy   until they went to a spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of the sea for her cure    she is able to control it now as long as she doesn t drive a car   ride elevators   follow in dancing   and is the woman on top when making love    in other words   she has to be in control of things    in her small fishing town she falls in love with a handsome macho latin waiter   toninho oliveira   murilo ben   cio   and marries him    they open up a successful restaurant   where she slaves away in the kitchen but he gets all the credit for it   even though he s a loafer    one night she catches him in bed with another girl and decides to leave for san francisco    we don t see her in flight   so i can t tell how she handled her motion sickness problem    unless she flew the plane    she visits her friend s apartment monica   harold perrineau jr       who is a cross dresser   blending right into the san francisco scene    to cast away her love for the irresistible toninho   she calls her spiritualist friend and gets her to cast an irreversible spell   freeing her from ever loving him again    her luck changes when a local tv producer cliff   mark feurerstein   gets a whiff of her cooking and storms into her cooking class as if were in a spell and presents her with her own live tv cooking show    you can really write the script from here on by yourself       as the despondent toninho begins to realize what a good thing he had   but things continue to go bad for him   there is a curse he caused on the fishing in his village   there is no chef to replace his wife   as the restaurant is about to close for good    so he comes to san francisco   figuring he can charm her again    he brings along with him his guitar playing musicians   the ones he used when courting her   when he serenaded her under her window    he sees his wife on tv with monica as her sidekick   the yuppie tv producer chasing after her   and sees that she is no longer charmed by him    when he sneaks on her tv show set and tries to woo her with his musical group and him singing corny love songs to her   the ratings go up and he s hired as a regular on the show    the show gets so big   that the network honchos come onboard   taking it national    but they want to change the ethnic flavor of the show   get rid of monica because he s a freak   have isabella cook with tabasco instead of the brazilian peppers she uses   and they change her ethnic dresses to low cut vanna white type of sexy dresses    cliff   her would be boyfriend   acts creepy and sides with the network big shots   even though he loved everything she did    these tv scenes were not only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos   they were revolting    it was an insult to one s intelligence    i m sure that i m not spoiling the ending for anyone   when i tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways and together they cook up a meal that breaks her spell of loving him again    if the film wasn t terrible enough   monica and cliff act on their attraction for each other and become lovers    it was so awkwardly done   that it had no sense of truth or humor to it    this film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in this film   because it doesn t look or feel like an almod   var film   the type of film it aspired to be   but more like a film that was interferred with from above    its more like a futile commercial film that is more annoying than charming and more dull than chic   as it searches for box office heaven    

Neg, there have been bad films in recent years    mr    magoo  was by far the worst ever made   the spectacularly bad  blue in the face    the horrible  baby genuises  and now  i woke up early the day i died     it may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie    the film s acting   if that s what you want to call it   is well mediocre to me    loaded with a sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save the film a bit   boy was i wrong    after escaping from a mental institution  the thief  played by billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty    he turns to burglary to survive   robs a loan back   kills the loan officer and runs with thousands    a country wide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him down    he ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it for later   comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere    now he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back   ultimately leading to a finale that is less that satisfying    a film which was based on a  long lost  script by ed wood   i have only one question   no dialogue   only music and movement where exactly is the point    the film moves along at a rather slow pace   but does have one advantage   the soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be offensive to some    it opens with a fun   innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that    some of the low points are when  the thief  steals a woman s purse   and then she faints   sandra bernhard as a dancer and tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom  the thief  kills to the music of  psycho     come on people get some new ideas already !  what s even worse is that the film has no plot at all    well to a certain extent it does   but who cares by the time the middle of the film arrives we re bored out of our mind and ready for something fun and exciting to happen     i woke up early the day i died  is a perfectly bad film    it shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make a movie    even with the huge cast talent   the film is a waste of my time and certainly a waste of yours    

Neg, movies can do the two big es very well   educate and entertain    in the best of all possible worlds   they accomplish both    on the red planet   they fail entirely    in the near future   a manned mission is sent to mars to observe primitive plant growth    this film does a remarkable job of demonstrating exactly how exciting watching algae grow would be    after some mumbo jumbo about an ecological disaster on earth and an interminable wait to reach the fourth planet   the ship falls apart almost as fast as the movie does    the ground crew of people you couldn t care less about is trapped on the surface without food   water or air and stalked by a deadly rogue cyberdog    the one potentially interesting character   carrie anne moss   spends her time alone in the orbiting ship talking to a computer    attempting to graft   2001   esque space mysticism with   terminator   robot horror   first time director antony hoffman can t seem to figure out what s going on    neither can we    didn t he have anyone who could step back from the shooting and make sure there was a coherent story    couldn t he have used the money saved by only having to pay half a dozen actors to hire a scriptwriter    there are so many mis steps    every opportunity to create dynamic tension is thwarted by plot holes and lackluster direction    why introduce the theme of faith vs   science if the crewman who could comment on it disappears early only to die  offscreen     the audience begins the film waiting for something to happen    two hours later   they re still waiting    despite our greatest hopes   there is no life on the red planet    

Neg, everyone knows that old rule    never work with children and animals      in this latest horror flick mimic case   it s  never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals  instead   as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience    the film begins in new york   where we see children dying from a mysterious disease   which is being carried by cockroaches    dr   susan tyler   sorvino   creates a genetically enhanced bug   the  judas  breed     however   which is designed to kill all cockroaches    the bug does it s job   the cockroaches all die   and the terror is gone     three years later  appears on the screen   and we discover that the judas breed is back   bigger than ever   and ready to kill    the spin on this bug   however   is that it can mimic it s predator   and in this case         it s  humans    that should teach us for squishing all those bugs    what should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere   tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued   almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace    perhaps the movie was trying to be thought provoking   and trying to avoid the  predator  type movie it could easily have become    if it is   then the director and writers have made the wrong move   because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest    the director   who bought us cronos   a far superior film   directs the film in a calm   and frankly dull movie    there are few exciting sequences   instead just a lot of people talking    if the dialogue was intelligent   then it would be all right   but it s sadly babbling nonsense    in fact   the script is embarrsingly weak   and the characterizations not much better   sorvino and company are as 2d as characters come   with the script not bothering to develop them    there is some action in this film   but it s directed in such an annoying way   it s just infuriating to watch    the camera cuts all over the place   disoreitating the audience   and instead of involving the audience in the action   it merely alienates them    the peformances are o   k   if slightly below average    sorvino is o   k   although she s not very good at conveying terror   or anything emotion really    the supporting cast are all sterotypes   with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth   a geeky scientist with spectacles   and what could be the most stereotypical mexican  old timer  ever    their reasonable good fun   however    mimic   then   may fail with it s story   pacing and characters   but the film does look good    like dark city   mimic is a definite case of style of content    it may be a bit too gloomy for it s own good   but the sets look nice   and parts of the film are directed well    but looks aren t good enough to save mimic from the depths of mediocre   somewhere where it shouldn t really belong    a good opportunity   then   wasted    a shame    overall rating= review by david wilcock   1998  

Neg, your first clue that something isn t gonna be quite right with the movie you re about to see   it s heavily christmas themed and its release date is   oh   say   at the end of february    your second clue that something isn t gonna be quite right with the movie you re about to see   charlize theron   one of the movie s dubious stars   makes an appearance on the daily show in which   when asked if her new movie s any good   she replies with the equivalent of a verbal sigh        assuring us that   yeah   it sure is a movie   all right !  and there s some scenes like those you d expect to find in a movie   and there s some action        and there s other        stuff        too    how to immediately grab my attention   open your movie with five dead guys in santa claus suits    then show a caption reading   six days earlier          ya know   i was honestly interested to find out what killed all those poor santas        how to immediately lose my attention   follow your opening scene with a terminally dull nice guys who don t deserve to be in prison scene    write a line for the one of prisoners like   i just want to go home and eat christmas dinner and watch some ball with my dad      then   have ben affleck actually say that line   on film   and forget to leave it on the cutting room floor    for good measure   throw in a poorly motivated prison riot and have affleck s best buddy stabbed        aw        and just two days before his release   too    already the cliches are piled on thick   and when it rains   it pours    how to take my attention   dash it violently against the rocks   and make it so that i m contemplating my strategy for calling   shotgun   about an hour before i know the credits will roll   deny your characters the ability to think    have ben affleck   for some reason i ll never understand   pretend he s his dead prison buddy so that he can get his girlfriend   played by charlize theron    have gary sinise show up and force the two of them to participate in a poorly planned casino heist    the villains  big idea    kidnap affleck because he used to be a security guard at the casino   force him to tell you where all the doors in the place are   then dress up in santa suits   create some   diversions   and rob the place    on paper   it seems like the stuff of a potential caper comedy   but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper and thinks he s looking at the makings for some sort of clever action crime thriller    it s not like the man isn t capable        far from it    he s the man responsible for classic political thrillers like the manchurian candidate and seven days in may    he wowed me with some the most memorable car chases i ve ever seen in last year s ronin    but he s certainly guilty of churning out some certifiable losers        put reindeer games on the shelf of shame with his 1996 version of the island of dr   moreau    step one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible   cast ben affleck in the role of the world s most generic hero    he gets no good one liners   he doesn t get to shoot or implode anything in new and interesting ways   and all we know about him is that he regrets his past as a car thief and wants a cup of hot chocolate and piece of pecan pie    his name is rudy   short for rudolph   in all likelihood    see   it s called reindeer games    get it    get it    shut up      in the past   affleck has been at his best as a supporting actor   and reindeer games does nothing to further his viability as a leading man    step two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible   gary sinise s villain dresses and looks like the most standard movie crook a filmmaker could have some up with    he s dirty and potty mouthed   he s got long   scruffy hair and a goatee   and i fully expected him to walk out of the casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them    he s also extremely inept at what he does    he thinks garish cowboy costumes and santa suits make acceptable disguises   and he trusts affleck s character to pull through even after   time and time and time again   he tricks him and lies to him and nearly kills him    but instead of tapping into the comic possibilities of this role   sinise seems to think he s playing some sort of tough   smart   and smooth criminal mastermind   rather than the complete moron that was obviously written into the script    [on a side note   gary sinise wins this week s   title !    award   as he s the one who gets to awkwardly cram the name of the movie into one of his lines early in the proceedings    last week s winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards   ]  how to take your bad idea and make things worse   include two or three plot twists that   instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent   make the plan seem even more ridiculous and unlikely    this is a bad movie    and what s worse is that   except for a few moments near the not so stunning conclusion as the preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous   reindeer games never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad    if they d done that much   at least i would have been entertained    

Neg,    come on   silent bob !  we re going to hollywood      starring jason mewes   kevin smith   will ferrell   shannon elizabeth   seann william scott   chris rock   jason lee   ben affleck    directed by kevin smith    rated r    jay and silent bob strike back is a dumb movie disguised in a smarmy interior    kevin smith   coming off the wonderful   challenging dogma   fills it with sub road trip gross out jokes and expects us to buy it because he s just oh so ironic    but when a movie is so self aware it becomes about nothing but itself   we can hardly be expected to pay for admission    jay and silent bob   two new jersey stoners who hang out at the doorstep of convenience store selling pot   have appeared in almost all of smith s movies but   if i m not mistaken   have not starred in one until now    they find out that there is a movie based on the comic book that is based on them being made in hollywood    this presents two problems   a   they haven t received a penny in royalties and b   nerds on the internet     what s the internet        are talking trash about them    what is there to do except go to hollywood and stop this movie from being made    on the way    they re hitchhiking   because who knew you needed tickets to take a bus       they run into a group of hotties who pretend to be with an animal rights group   but are really jewel thiefs who parade around in charlie s angels style outfits    of course   they set jay and silent bob up to look like the thieves   so that there is a massive manhunt going on during the second half of the film    will ferrell   who again proves himself incapable of doing anything but sketch comedy   shows up as the wildlife marshal inspector who thinks the two have stolen a monkey    the movie will probably please only smith s die hard   undiscerning fans   everyone else will be critical of this mind bogglingly stupid effort following some the sophisticated cinema that he churned out in years past    any appeal the movie has will come from the   in   jokes   most of which i think i understood   but the movie is   in   to the point of absurdity    there needs to be something holding it together other than its own smugness    once jay and silent bob get to hollywood   the movie abruptly switches gears from gross out comedy to ridiculously broad hollywood satire    countless   hot   movie stars and personalities make an appearance   from smith veterans matt damon and ben affleck to wes craven   but jay and silent bob strike back resorts to such low brow gags as another scream sequel with a monkey as the killer    get it    they re so desperate for another movie   they ran out of ideas and used a monkey !  a monkey !  as often happens with writers who are working below what they are actually capable of   most of the really good lines are throwaways   while the big   painstaking gags mostly fall flat    one of the funniest lines in the movie flies by   when asked to comment on the clitoris   don t ask     jay responds     the female clitoris      kevin smith is a talented writer   though i agree that his films would be better off if he d let a real director take the helm     and jay and silent bob strike back holds true to his promise to make a more facetious film    unfortunately   it s also shapeless   pointless and largely unfunny    smith s   verbal trampoline     as ben affleck once called his distinctive dialogue   takes a back seat to his dubious instincts as a populist filmmaker    this was supposed to be the movie that didn t offend anyone   but it s offensive because it s terrible    

Neg, synopsis   al simmons   top notch assasin with a guilty conscience   dies in a fiery explosion and goes to hell    making a pact with malebolgia   a chief demon there   simmons returns to earth 5 years later reborn as spawn   a general in hell s army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives   chains   and a morphing cape    sullen   wise cogliostro and flatulating   wisecracking violator vy for spawn s attention    comments   when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics   where he had made a name for himself as a first rate comic book penciller on the   spider man   titles   to join the newly formed   creator owned image comics   a new comic book legend was born   spawn    mcfarlane s   spawn   immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s    mcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate   allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max    the early   spawn   issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane s genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing    with the popularity of   spawn   and the success of the current warner bros    s batman film franchise   a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn    in the summer of 1997   hence   new line cinema released spawn   a live action film based on the groundbreaking series    this topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book   like me   numbed by how much spawn misses the mark    what happened    why is spawn so bad    todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo    i don t think   however   that his presence necessarily hurt   or helped   the film    i place the blame   in part   on the recent hollywood trend   fueled by public demand apparently   for special effects blow out movies utilizing the latest computer technology    these films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else   character   plot   dialogue   etc   spawn   reflecting this trend   shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics    hardly a minute goes by in this film without fires   explosions   knives and chains appearing out of nowhere   glowing eyes   or constantly transforming demons    a lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid   don t get me wrong   but   because the script and cast aren t engaging   spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper   the surface may capture the eye   but nothing exists underneath      spawn s translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level    mcfarlane s spawn was a tortured hero    a mercenary by trade   al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda    having died and journeyed to hell   he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda    simmons   however   discovers that his memories are fragmented   his body a creepy mess   and his wife married    despite his sometimes violent nature   readers couldn t help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld    spawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so    when the characters are developed   they seem absurd rather than touching    the cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot   a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat 16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world   do not help matters    spawn   in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman   also unwisely spends too much time on a villain   the violator   batman favored the joker over batman      john leguizamo   like jack nicholson in batman   receives top billing in the cast as the violator   michael jai white   al simmons / spawn   is second    i ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator    the film   however   spends so much time on the violator s offensive antics that they grate on the nerves    apparently meant to be the comic relief in the film   as nicholson was in batman     especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn   the violator s lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny   leaving the audience wishing he would leave    leguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role   but he is seen far too often in the film    michael jai white   a relative newcomer to theatrical releases   seems to be an appealing actor   and he handles his role adequately   but we see little of him without various masks on    more time needed to be spent on white s character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings    a special note should be made about martin sheen as the over the top   obnoxious   evil general wynn    easily the hammiest performance in the movie   it s hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much   after all   he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now    sheen s excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film    many other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down    mtv style   jerky   in your face editing is one of them    flames   for example   roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting    cogliostro   unlikely wannabe guide for spawn   serves as a poor narrator for the film    he goofily tells the audience   at one point   that   how much of [spawn s] humanity is left remains to be seen     as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another    the music   finally   assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue    loud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes    to be fair   however   marilyn manson s   long hard road out of hell   effectively compliments spawn s return to earth   while filter and the crystal method s     can t you   trip like i do   proves a surprisingly fitting theme song    for as good a comic book as it is     spawn   did not spawn a good movie    spawn   instead   suffers from too much pomp and circumstance   and too little plot and character development    it receives two stars for its technically well done special effects    many other films   though   have equal   if not superior   special effects and are much better    rated pg 13   spawn seems more violent than many r rated movies and probably wouldn t be appropriate for the very young    

Neg, adam sandler vehicles are never anything special   but continue to make a load of money    which really goes to show the sad state of cinema today    while good comedies like rushmore   to choose a recent example   gets limited release and doesn t make a lot of money   big daddy got a huge release and has made a lot of cash    it s also nothing special and doesn t deserve the money it s making    but i digress    sandler plays sonny koufax   a unemployed new yorker with a seemingly low mental age    his girlfriend makes a ultimatum to him   either wise up and get responsible   or she s leaving him    by a strange set of events   koufax ends up with julian   played by twins cole and dylan sprouse   a five year old kid    after a failed attempt to impress his girlfriend with the child   koufax decides he wants to keep the child    however   social worker mr brooks   mostel   finds out that koufax isn t the real father and wants to take julian back    koufax along with his new girlfriend layla   lauren adams   fight to keep the child    big daddy really isn t that good    many of the jokes revolve around toilet humour   and supposedly we are meant to find julian and sonny peeing against a wall to be funny    there s the occasional good one liner   but these are usually strangely delivered wrong and lose most of the humour    the film   after all these silly gags   then suddenly turns sentimental   and this is where big daddy really goes from bad to hideous    the court scene at the end of the film is useless and unbelievable   and not helped by the soppy overacting    it s a poor attempt to win over the audience    adam sandler basically plays the same role he has in his last few films   except the wedding singer      joey lauren adams is much   much better   and deserves a far better film than this trash    steve buscemi pops up in a funny cameo   and his scenes are pretty funny    rob schneider is also funny as a crazy delivery man    the two twins who play julian are o   k   they start out rather well   but then becoming annoying and brattish halfway through and finally turn  all american  wholesome goodness at the end of the film   where the tear juice is turned up high    big daddy is really nothing special   and is not even worth it for a few chuckles    although it is actually well put together   with nice direction   good production design and even some montages   this professionalism can t help the fact that the script and characters are trash    big daddy is for die hard fans of sandler   and that s about it    

Neg,    what is this   a homicide or a bad b movie      that is the prophetic question asked by one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movie    let me clear things up for you cupcake   this isn t a bad b movie   it s a really bad b movie    so bad   it s almost good    almost   but not quite    the movie starts off in the 1950 s with space aliens sending a botched experiment down to earth    it is a bunch of slug like creatures that kill people and take over their bodies    the slugs  first and only victim in the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of no danger to anybody    that is   until two loser university students unfreeze him in 1986    he   and the slugs inside him   promptly begin wreaking havoc and turning more co eds into slug zombies    a slightly crazed cop   tom atkins   and the requisite girl with the face of an angel   jill whitlow   join these two geeky university students   jason lively and steve marshall   to do battle with the slugs    it more or less falls on the four of them to make the world safe again from the evil slugs    the acting is bad with a capital b   the story is worse    and the special effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek and what you see in a home movie    the only saving grace was the requisite tit shot courtesy of jill whitlow    it had absolutely nothing to do with the story    but i liked it    actually   it was the high point of the movie for me    of course   that isn t really saying much    the story moves around in a hap hazard fashion    which gives it a leg up on some other horror films    unlike most movies of this genre   there actually is a story    not a great one   but it is there    this is one in a long line of movies from the 1980 s that were thrown together to capitalize off the success of the friday the 13th   halloween and nightmare on elm street movies    you could randomly select a movie out of the horror section of you local video store and probably luck into something just as good if not better    but night of the creeps might make a nice addition to a b movie horror marathon    just don t be too upset if you can t find it    you really won t be missing that much    

Neg, can you say   dated      you can if you ve seen rosemary s baby which   like the exorcist   was a thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release       mystery science theater 3000   has skewered the bad films of the past   but let me tell you   it could do a number on the   good   ones too    rosemary s baby stars mia farrow   from the time she was actually good looking   as an innocent housewife and her not so innocent husband   john cassavettes     an actor who takes an easy   albeit evil   road to success    it all seems so harmless in the beginning    mia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed       there s also a skull in the living room   but it s only for decoration      their elderly neighbors pop in for a housewarming    all s well for about the first hour of this slow moving film   until mia eats some of the neighbors  chocolate mousse and passes out    when she comes to   she finds herself in a darkened room with a bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and a big   evil man raping her    a foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen    it seems like a dream and   when she finds herself pregnant   she almost forgets about it    and everyone s helping with the pregnancy    the neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink   a good luck charm for her to wear around her neck   and the name of an obstetrician who s been in the business 66   6  years    meanwhile   mia begins having chronic stomach pains and losing a lot of weight    before too long she looks just like the lead singer of the cranberries    that s when you know your health s failing    the only person in the movie who s the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend   maurice evans   who calls mia up to give her the bad news    and immediately falls into a coma    by about the two hour mark i felt the same way    rosemary s baby is way too long   and leads up to a payoff that s about as boring and laughable as the rest of the movie    i guess someone put a spell on this movie    

Neg, synopsis   back up quarterback moxxon becomes starting quarterback midway through his senior year of high school   even though he d rather read   slaughterhouse five   than the playbook    evil football coach kilmer throws away moxxon s book   though   while the evil team physician injects painkillers into the players    in the meantime   moxxon s kid brother forms a cult   and a bubblegum blond cheerleader smears whip cream on herself to seduce the new star quarterback    comments   since i usually review horror and science fiction films   i feel a little out of my league discussing this teen football movie       pun intended    thank you !    varsity blues was produced by mtv   and it really shows    several extended scenes allow for a continual soundtrack of mediocre pop songs meant to appeal to the adolescent male audience this crap was intended for    the teenagers all have reasons for their melodramatic angst    the adults all have problems   of course   and   as one dimensional characters   they are all fanatically obssessed with how their local high school football team performs    yes   this movie represents high school life in mtv land    this is a land where your health teacher is also a part time stripper   your ice cream store attendant girlfriend wears an egyptian ankh around her neck   your kid brother forms a   cute   cult   your football coach is an uncaring   obssessive madman   and your friends  lives consist of nothing but getting laid and driving around in cop cars naked    all you   as the main character   want to do   however   is read   slaughterhouse five   and attend brown university in the fall    well   at least this is a little more realistic than mtv s   the real world      varsity blues stars james van der beek   this week s teen tv star making the leap to the big screen    he plays the hick moxxon adequately   though some of his emotional dialogue will make people chuckle         you dawn t own mah life !    who would want to      jon voight   the stock evil guy in countless other movies   is   surprise   the stock evil guy here    but is he really evil   or is he a product of society    after all   everybody   young and old   in this movie has no life whatsoever and do nothing but obssess over high school football    maybe the pressures of the 90 screaming fans at the football field drove evil coach kilmer evil    the film s screenplay never answers this burning question    at times   iliff s story does show glimmers of touching or humorous scenes   but   before the audience gets their hopes up that there might be something redeeming in this movie   they get trashed with another lengthy party sequence or overwrought football game    the movie s pacing is slow   and the plot turns are mindnumbingly obvious from start to finish    i suppose i m being a little hard on varsity blues    maybe i m just a little miffed that i had to pay 3 bucks to see it   even though it was dollar night at the cinema    something about a request from the studio made the theater charge more money    i found the film oftentimes ludicrous and boring    three guys in front of us smuggled beer into the the theater    i wished i had thought of that    alcohol   lots of it   may have helped the viewing experience    

Neg, renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean claude van damme on the action star s 1997 pairing with dennis rodman    double team    and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick   stylish   and somewhat diverting action timekiller    tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels    knock off    but this time around   style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous   and at worst incomprehensible   nor hide a host of truly lousy performances    writer steven e   desouza s fairly straightforward plotline isn t as outre as  double team  s strange yarn involving a secret think tank/prison   but it makes about as much sense   which is little    van damme plays marcus ray   a hong kong based sales rep for a jeans company   !   who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip sized bombs in hk product exports to the u   s     dolls   electronic equipment   and   yes   jeans    it s all part of some type of ransom scheme   but all i remember is  and i kid you not  graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world   bombs detonating   and an hat wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter               which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout  knock off     while all of van damme s films have its share of unintentional laughs   mostly due to the stiff acting   skills   of the physically agile van damme    knock off  delivers more than usual   though not as many as van damme s embarrassing directorial effort   1996 s  the quest       a lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza     i smoked that badass like a roman candle !    and   entrepreneurship   babycakes !    standing out among my favorites    but it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of  knock off  s laughs    van damme is true to laughable form   perhaps even worse than usual    early scenes actually  require  him to make funny with co star rob schneider   improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcus s business partner     and the sight and sound of the still heavily accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way    even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug    paul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneider s cia superior   and lela rochon   playing an investigator for the jeans company   spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode    in rochon s defense   though   her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs   exquisite bone structure   and perky bosoms   the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage    tsui picks up where he left off visually in  double team    juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work    here   though   tsui s visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill   coming off as desperate attempts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise    for each nifty trick tsui pulls off   such as a recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices   there are others that are completely superfluous    this is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context    for instance   one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in a box    as he puts his hand in   the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in a rectangle at the corner of the screen    it s undoubtedly an interesting visual   but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something    the test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences   but surprisingly   those in  knock off  leave much to be desired    tsui does what he can to make something of them   employing freeze frames   blurred motion   and unconventional camera angles   but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by desouza    there isn t anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger/land mine fight in  double team    let alone anything remotely close to tsui s legendary hong kong works   but that s a given going in      if tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woo s stateside success   he would do best to break free from van damme        before it s too late    if he continues his involvement with b grade movies such as  knock off    the respect he has from hk action fans will continue to diminish        that is   if it hasn t already disappeared entirely after this fiasco

Neg, some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning   a live action version of mr    magoo being a prime example    the cartoon figure mr   magoo   the bumbling blind man   can be quite funny   but only in small doses and only within the confines of animated images    if you think naked gun star leslie nielsen is a dubious choice to play the role of the short guy who runs into walls   you are right   but there is an even more astonishing selection    for a director they tapped hong kong s stanley tong   whose resume consists mainly of a handful of movies featuring martial arts expert jackie chan    the story   such that there is one   is about a large   stolen ruby   which looks a woolworth reject    mr   magoo gets it and   of course   does not realize he has it    mayhem then ensues as the bad and the good guys chase each other with mr   magoo frequently oblivious to the fact that anyone is being chased    like home alone 3 but without any class   mr    magoo can only be described as painfully bad    fifteen minutes of it feels like an eternity    the movie s humor is pathetically lame   and the pacing is way off    when one is stuck in a theater for an hour and a half watching what claims to be a motion picture   one looks for some solace    mr    magoo provides only three such moments    the movie begins and ends with the classic cartoon version of the character   who exudes his usual charm    the only other saving grave in the movie itself is angus   the sweet little bulldog    angus demonstrates more genuine emotions and a wider acting range than any of the humans in the picture    finally   the ending credits contain outtakes of the movie   which have some of the genuineness and spontaneity that the movie badly lacked    rather than attempt to adapt mr   magoo to a non cartoon movie   nielsen makes the strategic mistake of trying to literally be a human version of the cartoon    he has trouble sustaining the squinting eyes and the affected voice   and even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny    my wife managed to get some sleep during the movie   but i was not so lucky    hopefully   this picture will force producers to think harder about which subjects have promise and which do not    mr   magoo runs 1   37    it is rated pg for comic violence and would be acceptable for all ages    my son jeffrey   age 8   said he thought the movie was good and really funny   but recommends you not choose it if you want an action movie    he said he liked home alone 3 much more    his friend maxim   age 9   said that he thought it was good but very silly and parts did not make sense    his other friend nickolas   age 8   said he d give the movie * * * 1/2   but that it was really silly    

Neg, when robert forster found himself famous again after appearing in   jackie brown     he immediately signed up for a little film called   american perfekt      this was almost two years ago    i waited patiently for the film to be released   but it never was    finally   i forgot about it    the other day   though   while i was perusing the selection of the local video store   i stumbled upon   you guessed it     american perfekt      i immediately rented it and with a certain amount of glee   rushed home to view it    having now seen the film   i understand why it never saw theatrical release       american perfekt   is a jumbled mess    the storyline is non existent    it took me half the movie just to figure out what was going on    and at that point   the only thing i really knew for sure was that the movie was * never * going to introduce a plot of some sort    it wants to get by on quirkyness and so called charm alone   and it just doesn t work    robert forster plays a psychiatrist who picks up amanda plummer   and they head off on the road together    along the way to no discernable destination   they run into all sorts of kooky and wacky characters    i suppose this free wheeling   no plot style is supposed to give the film an element of danger and excitment   but all it did was make me sleepy    i m all for trying new things within the realm of film   but not at the expense of coherence    nothing in this movie makes sense    the actions of the characters go unexplained   even when they re truly bizarre    i ll give you an example   without giving too much away    david thewlis has a part as a drifting con man    at one point   mid way through the movie   he runs forster and plummer off the road with his car    as he passes them   we see that his face is covered in blood    do you think we would get an explanation as to what happened to him    you would think so   wouldn t you       american perfekt   is a waste of time    nothing is gained from watching this movie   except maybe a migraine    and if you do rent it   don t bother trying to figure out what s going on in the hopes that everything will be resolved by the end    this doesn t happen    and no explanation is given for the misspelling of   perfect     either    

Neg, you d think that after awhile hollywood would stop trying to make movies out of video games    it hasn t worked so far       street fighter         super mario brothers         wing commander         mortal kombat      not a watchable film in the bunch    still i held out some hope for   tomb raider      after all   the game s premise is heavily influenced by the indiana jones trilogy and all the mummy movies   so there are cinematic elements imbedded in the concept    however   despite the potential of the project     tomb raider   proves to be yet another bomb    the plot is a convoluted accumulation of nonsense probably borrowed from a dozen bad movies    there s a once ever 5000 years alignment of planets coming up   and the illuminati have to find both halves of an ancient triangle that controls time in order to take over the world    of course   the ancient folks who divided the triangle buried the halves in tombs on opposite sides of the world    our heroine   lady lara croft   angelina jolie     finds the key that opens the tombs in relics that her dead father   jon voight   dug up    she figures that if she gets the triangle   she can bring her dad back from the dead    of course   no one was expecting much of a plot from this movie anyway    in both video games and action movies   the plot is just an excuse for the action sequences    however   the action in   tomb raider   shows little style or originality    there s lots of shooting and some kung fu fightin    but none of it progresses beyond the level of a cheap direct to cable flick    the other goofy archeologist flick of the summer     the mummy returns     was much better   it had its flaws   but its action was creative and large scale    since winning her academy award for   girl   interrupted     jolie hasn t taken any projects that would display her acting talents       tomb raider   seems to be more interested in displaying her breasts   so much attention is drawn to them that it s a shame there s no oscar for best performance by a wonderbra    while we don t see much of her acting ability   with the exception of a wonderful upper crust british accent     we do get a hint of jolie s less savory side    considering the rumors of incest that hang over jolie and her supposed obsession with death   having lara be obsessed with resurrecting her dead father   and uninterested in any of the living males around her   seems a poor choice    having jolie s real life father jon voight play the dead dad makes it even creepier    i haven t decided what to make of director simon west yet    his first feature was the star studded disaster   con air     but my opinion of him improved with   the general s daughter     which was thick with sultry atmosphere    now this train wreck    i hope he improves again because his next project is the big screen version of the cult tv series   the prisoner      hollywood has already screwed up   the avengers     and   the prisoner   represents a chance for redemption       by the way   speaking of british tv     red dwarf   fans should look for chris   rimmer   barrie in his first major film role      

Neg, in the interest of being generous   i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black    sir anthony hopkins   playing a super rich media mogul   has gathered his family around him for dinner    his oldest daughter   played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing     who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party   presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes   which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake    the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes    hopkins   frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair   does what any man in his position would do   he punts    whichever one you like   dear   he says    and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do   she cries    i liked that scene for two reasons    first   the cakes looked really cool    second   it was   perhaps   the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act    meet joe black is chock full of odd performances   people doing things for no discernible reason at all   and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot    it s easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani   but it s even easier to sleep right through it   two people on my row managed it quite nicely      the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess    i know my audience had problems with the movie   because they thought it was a comedy    case in point   everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie    however   the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani       it s not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death   but it makes a certain kind of sense      it shouldn t take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr   pitt    and indeed they do   after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt     because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished    well   when that happened   the audience howled with laughter   and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous    so   if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing room humor are funny   i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately    anyway   the deceased lawyer s body   no worse the wear from its massive injuries   is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role    the idea is that death   given the pen name of joe black   so as not to disturb others   wants to take a holiday and experience the world    if this weren t hollywood   we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death   but since it is   we get scene after scene of fish out of water humor   just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who s wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn t know how to act in our society    it also doesn t help that the character of death is written so inconsistently    he claims to be on vacation   but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani   just try to get your travel agent to book that one      he speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois    he knows everything about some characters   nothing about others    and as played by brad pitt   he s not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing   he s just there    it s as if someone told pitt     never mind about acting in this picture   son   just stand there and look pretty      it s as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie    i ve used the phrase   angel of death   in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt s performance with this year s best angel performance   nicolas cage s in city of angels    where pitt is cold and unfeeling   cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows    where cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man   pitt is aloof and arrogant    cage struck instant chemical sparks with co star meg ryan   where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani s character is so shallow that she can t see beyond pitt s good looks    the movie s other top name is a much better actor   but that doesn t save meet joe black    sir anthony hopkins isn t given much better material to work with   unfortunately    he plays one of these good hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood       one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins s character more realistically evil      hopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker   but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world    of course   no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder    but i have to wonder   and in this movie   you have a very long time to wonder   how you or i would act in a similar situation   especially if you or i were a multimillionaire    hopkins pretty much goes to the office    and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation    fans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated   i m sure    i stayed awake all the way through meet joe black   and i m asking myself why    movies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest   which is what i m going to do now    go spend time with your family   go volunteer for a local charity   heck   go take a nap    don t go see meet joe black   because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death       curtis edmonds     no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to tell about it

Neg, from a major league baseball radio broadcast   featuring play by  play man harry canary and color man whitey hashbrown   with special guest commentator james berardinelli    hc   as we go to the top of the 8th   we re joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli   who s here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie   major league   back to the minors   the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors    nice to see you   jim    as a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer   can you give us the scoop on the new flick    jb   my opinion   the producers should have stopped while they were ahead   and that was nine years ago    one entry was definitely enough   and i m surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2   this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct to video    it s worse than a mediocre made for tv feature    i should also mention that this movie likely won t play all that well in cleveland    now that the real indians are perennial contenders   they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks    actually   most of the action involves the twins  aaa minor league club   the buzz   rather than the actual major league franchise    hc   sorry to interrupt   jim   but we still have to do play by play for the game on the field    leading off this inning is john warren    he steps into the batter s box and takes kent s pitch low for ball one    wh   so   the story s strictly minor league   right    what s it about    jb   scott bakula   the guy from quantum leap   plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell    when twins owner roger dorn   once again portrayed by corbin bernsen   needs a new manager for his aaa team   he offers the job to gus   who is now faced with two daunting tasks   turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson   played by walt goggins   for a promotion to   the show      with the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano   dennis haysbert     rube baker   eric bruskotter     and isuro tanaka   takaaki ishibashi     gus gets the buzz on the right track    in fact   he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the big league club   leonard huff   played with over the top relish by ted mcginley      soon   dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus  overachieving group against huff s overpaid   last place bunch    wh   can we guess who wins    jb   the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when you ve already seen the box score    on top of that   none of the mock ups are presented with much flair    they re not just boring   they re lackluster    but the major league movies have never been about drama or tension   they ve been about using baseball situations to generate laughs    hc   warren fouls off a fastball    1 and 1    wh   are there lots of yuks in this one    jb   not one   from start to finish    i enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny    okay   a lot of the jokes were sophomoric   but they made me laugh    the two sequels haven t just been stale   but their humor quotient has been abysmally low    even bob uecker s once sharp one liners have turned lame   and they re the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing    hc   here s the 1 1 pitch    looooooong drive   fair or foul   foul ball !  the count goes to 1 and 2    wh   does the film at least get the baseball details correct    jb   yes    there aren t any glaring errors like there were in one of the best ever baseball movies   the natural    but i d gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story   believable characters   or even a little genuine humor    heck   the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league   back to the minors    wh   it s nice to see old friends one more time   isn t it    like cerrano   tanaka   and dorn    jb   depends on whether you really care that anyone is back    there aren t any real characters here   just an assortment of cliched oddballs    yeah   the voodoo hitter   the catcher who can t throw back to the pitcher   the japanese player   and the conceited player turned owner have all returned   but who really cares    they have no depth    notable absences include tom berenger s veteran and charlie sheen s   wild thing      we don t really miss them   though    hc   breaking ball   low and outside    2 and 2    wh   so you re saying that we should give this one a miss    jb   that s right    to use baseball terminology   it s a three pitch strikeout    if you re looking for a good movie that involves baseball   try popping the natural   field of dreams   bull durham   or even the first major league into the vcr    actually   this is an oddly timed release   since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in theaters    even the minor league seasons are already underway    don t bother with major league   back to the minors    it s a wretched time  waster    wh   thanks for the advice    jb   you re welcome    hc   and here s the 2 2 pitch    fouled back   right into this booth    hey   jim   heads up !  oops    somebody better get him some ice for that    he may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies   but he needs to learn not to duck into foul balls    odd how warren seemed to aim that ball right at him   almost as if he has a grudge to settle    anyway   back to the action on the field    

Neg,    mandingo   has traditionally been seen as one of two things   either a much needed revisionist look at slavery in the south   or in the words of film critic leonard maltin     a trashy potboiler   that   appeals only to the s&m crowd      actually   i think   mandingo   is a strange combination of the two   although it fails on both fronts    it s too trashy to be good drama   but too dramatic to be good trash    the story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell   james mason   and his son   hammond   perry king      one day in new orleans   hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede   heavyweight boxer ken norton      although the movie never explains it   a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley    according to the movie   mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves    hammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him    hammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves    meanwhile   hammond has married his cousin   blanche   susan george     because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild    hammond   however   is happier spending nights with his   bed wench     the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex    it is quickly apparent that hammond   despite his overt racism   is more in love with his bed wench   a sensitive slave girl named ellen   brenda sykes     than he is with blanche    hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had   pleasured   her before he did    of course   it s fine that he s slept with numerous slave girls   but the fact that his wife   a   white lady     had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her    so blanche is usually left lonely and sex starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen    blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child    hammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half black child   although it s okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond     so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth   and hammond poisons blanche    hammond then finds mede   shoots him twice in the shoulder   and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water    yes   you read right   the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive    judging only by the plot     mandingo   is pure sexploitation    the main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible   with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society    when   mandingo   was released in 1975   it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail   this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs    dramatically     mandingo   is weak and unfocused   and historically it s mostly confused    if one were to judge history by this film   it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality   not economics    not once in the film do we see any of the slaves working   except for a few house servants    the men spend most of the time sitting around   while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner    there is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves   but   mandingo s   overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick   although there s plenty of violence    fights   vicious beatings   shootings   and the aforementioned human boiling sequence    thrown in for good measure      some tried to write off   mandingo   as a blaxploitation film   one of a number of quickly made   low budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies   but it s not that easy       mandingo   was studio financed by paramount pictures   and produced by dino de laurentiis   the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as   the bible     1966     the remake of   king kong     1976     and the ill fated   dune     1984      the director was richard fleischer   a veteran who was best known for several special effects laden action movies including   20   000 leagues under the sea     1954   and   fantastic voyage     1966     as well as such superior suspense films as   the narrow margin     1952      the script   based on the supermarket best seller by ken ostott   and the subsequent play by jack kirkland     was penned by norman wexler   who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on   serpico      james mason   perry king   and susan george were well known and respected actors   mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt     and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career    so why is   mandingo   so bad    a number of reasons   including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job    wexler s script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive   it combines stereotyped slave talk     yessuh   massuh       stereotyped southern white trash talk     fer whut re you gittin  outta bed         and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk     if you see me hang   you gonna know you killed a black brother !        fleischer s direction is clumsy   especially during the fight scenes   and all the actors give weak performances   especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable    nevertheless   credit should be given where credit is due    despite its exploitative nature     mandingo   was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery    until then   there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery    even classics such as   gone with the wind     1939   can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter       mandingo   reassessed the south   and showed that it wasn t all beautiful plantations   green fields   and pretty sunsets    but all this is constantly undermined by the film s negligible point of view    it claims to see things from the black perspective   but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners    with a little more maturity and different handling     mandingo   might have been an effective   worthwhile film    while it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery   it never deals with them    the issues the movie brings up are worthwhile   but wexler s script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing    there is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner   but   mandingo   never does it    steven spielberg touched on that same topic in   schindler s list     1993     by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid    the difference between that film and   mandingo   is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair   unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma       mandingo   is satisfied to simply show some skin   and because of that   its   trashy potboiler   nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished    

Neg, retrospective   city of the living dead   1980    a film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson  i once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as   dim witted      and by golly   just about all other words fail me when confronted with a dog like city of the living dead    although the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career   this is not one of them    two points in the movie s favour   the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi   keep things from falling totally into the abyss   but by and large city of the living dead is a failure    and like most cinematic failures   it comes down to bad writing   dumb performances and lousy direction    the story starts in new york when   during a seance   a medium   katherine mccoll   sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich   massachusetts    for reasons we won t go into here   this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth    the medium apparently dies of fright during the seance   but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by a crusty old journalist   christopher george      that scene in itself is a howler   why would you bust open a coffin with a large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside    and don t cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before they re buried    anyway   off the two of them go to dunwich to save the world   where various grisly goings on are already happening as all saints day approaches    fulci s graphic gore is in evidence once again   but here it only serves to further highlight the film s flimsy script and plodding direction    the dialogue   in all manner of speaking   is unspeakable    not bad in the quotable sense   like an ed wood film   but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious   lets explain the plot   type approach    mccoll doesn t have a clue who her character is   deadly serious one minute   frivolous the next   she at times is genuinely hard to watch    and the geezer   the actor s name escapes me   who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach than mccoll as the film progresses    christopher george s performance is salvageable   but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by a zombie and we don t care    in fact we don t care for anyone in city of the living dead   though in other fulci films that hasn t mattered so much when he was on form as a stylist and an ideas man   as he was in the beyond    as a director   some of fulci  idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly and annoying here    he constantly uses extreme close ups of people s eyes   a ridiculous technique which suggests an attempt to convey the emotion that his dialogue and actors aren t capable of    and despite some gruesome violence   he barely manages a single scare in the entire film    long time collaborator fabio frizzi   talented but always erratic   offers a patchy soundtrack that veers between eerie   gothic death marches and woefully inappropriate electro pop that s quite frankly embarrassing    fulci s other films of this period may be flawed   house by the cemetery   the beyond   the black cat   but they are nonetheless films with more inspiration   atmosphere and better dialogue than this turkey    for completists only    

Neg, warner brothers   rated pg 13   mild violence   sexual situations     132 minutes  director   luis mandoki  screenplay   gerald di pego   from the novel by nicholas sparks    cast   kevin costner   robin wright penn   paul newman   illeana douglas   robbie coltrane   jesse james   john savage    review by   geoff berkshire  i m not an overly cynical guy    there have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years    however   i have my limits and i also have standards    this brings us to the subject at hand   message in a bottle   the big ticket romance that warner brothers  unleashed upon the movie going public just in time for valentine s day    the story   what little of it that there is   involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne   robin wright penn   dealing with her recent divorce and trying to raise her young son jason   jesse james      during a brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean    the letter   written to a mystery woman named catherine   instantly captivates her    upon her return   theresa shares it with her best friend lina   illeana douglas     her boss charlie   robbie coltrane     and the entire city of chicago   the newspaper publishes an article about it      it turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake   kevin costner   and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down    he turns out to have a colorful father   paul newman   but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing    this is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship    of course she doesn t tell him that she found his letter   she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later   preferably right after they first make love      this way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened    the discovery of the message and garret s discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and a quarter hour running time of this film    there s a truly lame subplot about garret s relationship with his dead wife s family   he gets into a bar fight with her brother   played by john savage   and then the necessary tear jerking ending    a fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die   although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel    the actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced   and unintentionally humorous   sequences filmed since        well   since costner s the postman   1997      message in a bottle is one slow moving film    last year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer and meet joe black but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this    they also had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out technical work    message in a bottle has a decent enough cast but they re fighting the material all the way   and losing badly    costner and   especially   wright penn are both likable and attractive enough to cheer for but their characters are simply too boring    they also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry    the supporting players are given very little to do    the reliable douglas is particularly wasted    old pro newman gives his all and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of a film    a confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played    however   too frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are    the film is very polished on the technical side to be sure but it only works to undercut the story    gabriel yared   who previously set the romantic moods of the english patient   1996   and city of angels   1998   with his scores   overdoes it a bit here    caleb deschanel s camera makes everything look a little too beautiful    do the offices of the chicago tribune really need to look heavenly    the editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times    the real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego    working from a best  selling novel by nicholas sparks   which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county     di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times    its strict adherence to clich   s brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer   1998      there simply isn t an original scene in this film    the dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking    this is director mandoki s first film since when a man loves a woman   1994     the solid meg ryan/andy garcia romance    he s simply going through the motions with this    message in a bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with what dreams may come   1998   as one of the most misguided romances of the decade    

Neg, it s almost amusing to watch 21 year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed in sally potter s follow up to 1997 s the tango lesson   the man who cried    the gen y actress   with her cold stare and big   black eyes   has appeared in an impressive range of films   but she doesn t even come close to being the bold heroine the film   set against the historical backdrop of world war 2   requires her to be    ricci   whose character is shockingly silent and blank   showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern   shares most of her scenes with the astounding cate blanchett   quite an amusing sight to behold    blanchett s lola   a paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie   is bold   interesting and layered   everything our heroine lacks    co star of the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy   blanchett has a good seven inches on ricci   sports twice the makeup and dons a flashy wardrobe    the actress inhabits the role   as she always so remarkably does   with a fervor and life that makes you want her to hold the screen as the film s lead rather than her dull companion    important historical events involving hitler and his nazis scatter themselves across the film   these landmarks serve as the film s little conflict    obviously   the tables are turned in the life of suzie by these events   whose jewish origin is unknown among her parisian colleagues    the man who cried has many aspirations   none of which come full circle by the film s close    there are forced messages here and there     go forward   always go forward     lola preaches to suzie   there s romance between suzie and a fellow target of hitler s nazis   the gypsy cesar   johnny depp   who   like ricci   barely gets to speak     lola struggles with her character that desires above all things wealth and men who have it   and at the core of all these devices lies suzie s desire to travel to america   where her father journeyed after leaving her and her mother years ago    the film s main problem is that potter isn t skilled enough to tell the epic sized story of suzie    the time period s instability   the conflicting social classes   the prejudice against suzie from all those around her in her new life   serving as both writer and director   potter throws in some of each   but hardly an inch of depth is to be found in any    by the time the sigh inducing climax hits   the believability and complete absence of focus leave one ready to leave the theater    the film s falling action is weirdly unsatisfying and unlikely   are we really meant to believe any of this could happen    contrastingly   in its moving final scene   the man who cried strikes a note that is made effective in its ties to the emotional beginning of the film    although it s apparent that potter can t grasp what she reaches   i m puzzled as to why she reaches for so much in the first place    ricci s suzie is meant to be the film s core   from the extended flashback at the film s beginning to the quickly drawn ending   everything seen in the film   in some way   relates to her    so why then does potter spend so much time on subplots involving other individuals    the character of suzie is too present for the man who cried to work as an ensemble   but not present enough for the film to be ricci s    the almost constant lack of flow and one note tone with which potter depicts the man who cried are somewhat improved upon by sacha vierny s beautiful cinematography that renders the film s various locations wonderfully    also worthy of note are lindy hemming s costumes that help to depict the area quite nicely    and then there s the music    from minute one to minute ninety seven   there s hardly a moment when the wavering   skilled voice of an opera singer or the rhythms of the gypsy music don t undercut the action   the notes stricken both overwhelm   particularly john turturro   portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio   whose money and reputation catch lola s interest   and accompany   oftentimes   the perfect chords are captured to undermine the state of the film s characters and reinforce that state      potter obviously cares much about each and every musical note   unfortunately   the same effort isn t given towards   almost   everything else    

Neg, how do films like mouse hunt get into theatres    isn t there a law or something    this diabolical load of claptrap from steven speilberg s dreamworks studio is hollywood family fare at its deadly worst    mouse hunt takes the bare threads of a plot and tries to prop it up with overacting and flat out stupid slapstick that makes comedies like jingle all the way look decent by comparison    writer adam rifkin and director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible for this swill    the plot   for what its worth   concerns two brothers   nathan lane and an appalling lee evens   who inherit a poorly run string factory and a seemingly worthless house from their eccentric father    deciding to check out the long abandoned house   they soon learn that it s worth a fortune and set about selling it in auction to the highest bidder    but battling them at every turn is a very smart mouse   happy with his run down little abode and wanting it to stay that way    the story alternates between unfunny scenes of the brothers bickering over what to do with their inheritance and endless action sequences as the two take on their increasingly determined furry foe    whatever promise the film starts with soon deteriorates into boring dialogue   terrible overacting   and increasingly uninspired slapstick that becomes all sound and fury   signifying nothing    the script becomes so unspeakably bad that the best line poor lee evens can utter after another run in with the rodent is     i hate that mouse      oh cringe !  this is home alone all over again   and ten times worse    one touching scene early on is worth mentioning    we follow the mouse through a maze of walls and pipes until he arrives at his makeshift abode somewhere in a wall    he jumps into a tiny bed   pulls up a makeshift sheet and snuggles up to sleep   seemingly happy and just wanting to be left alone    it s a magical little moment in an otherwise soulless film    a message to speilberg   if you want dreamworks to be associated with some kind of artistic credibility   then either give all concerned in mouse hunt a swift kick up the arse or hire yourself some decent writers and directors    this kind of rubbish will just not do at all    

Neg, the premise of the new james wong film   final destination   is that alex browning   the protagonist   prevents six of his friends from boarding a doomed airplane   thereby cheating fate    however   fate is not so easily bested   and alex s friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances    essentially   this premise is a clever way to make a slasher flick without the slasher    unfortunately   this is practically the only clever thing about the film    as far as teen horror flicks go   final destination is better than many    there is enough shocking death   graphic gore   and requisite black humor to provide the essential   roller coaster   type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick    unfortunately   this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this genre    the relationships between the main characters are tenuous and their motivations are meaningless except as excuse to set up the next death    the scene where two of the characters break into a funeral home to view the body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary and dramatic but features some of the dumbest dialogue i have witnessed    if you are looking for a saturday night thriller to scare your date   this film might do the trick    other than that   wait until it goes into heavy rotation on cable    

Neg, i have a great idea for a movie   one that can t miss    see   i ve got coolio to do a song for the soundtrack   and about fifty athletes and celebrities to do cameo appearances    it s about professional basketball   so i ll release it right around the nba finals to guarantee added publicity    as for what the movie is actually about       well   that will all sort itself out eventually    i figure it will be a comedy   so i ll throw a half dozen writers at it and take the best of whatever they come up with    maybe we ll put a gender spin on it   see if we can get some women out to see it   too    eddie is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any other kind    twister   as inane as the script might have been   at least required some creative technicians   mission   impossible   overwrought plot and all   at least involved genuine effort    eddie just sits there   hawking up a formula story without any laughs   and makes every possible bad decision when a decision is required    whoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin   a new york limo driver and die hard knicks fan who is suffering through a dismal season for her beloved team    coach john bailey   dennis farina   has lost control of his overpaid prima donnas   and the losses are beginning to mount    the dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess   frank langella   to try a publicity stunt in which a lucky fan will get to be an honorary coach of the team    the winner   surprise   surprise   is eddie   who becomes a fan favorite   and eventually the actual coach    the knicks continue to lose   but eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops    incidentally   the knicks eventually start winning    please raise your hand if that comes as a shock   and i will invite you to my all night marathon of the bad news bears   major league   angels in the outfield   the mighty ducks   the big green   cool runnings and little giants    awful teams in sports comedies make miraculous turnarounds   it s what they do    those teams usually involve kids   for a very sound comedic reason   it s funnier when they screw up   and they re more sympathetic    those which  don t  involve kids usually have actual actors in the lead roles   for another very sound comedic reason   they generally have developed some sort of comic timing    eddie was cast under the misguided premise that it s easier to make basketball players look like actors than it is to make actors look like basketball players    this finds nba players like greg ostertag   dwayne schintzius   rick fox and malik sealy delivering punch lines as though they were reading them for the first time off a bazooka wrapper   though sacramento kings center olden polynice has a nice moment describing a black hole to fellow players      perhaps that all didn t matter to anyone because there are so few punch lines   and because the whole film is one big casting gimmick    steve rash directs the spiritless script as though waving a flag of surrender and screaming     don t blame me   i just work here      perhaps it was patently obvious to him that eddie isn t a movie    it s a cameo appearance that trips over a plot every once in a while    among the notables who lend their faces to this travesty are donald trump   new york mayor rudolph giulianni   former new york mayor ed koch   david letterman   letterman regulars mujibur rahman and sirajul islam   espn broadcaster chris berman and knicks announcer marv albert   as well as dozens of nba players and several nba arenas    and those are the real jokes in eddie    nothing these individuals say or do is funny   you are supposed to be laughing simply because you notice     hey   it s donald trump !    or   hey   it s mujibur and sirajul !    it s difficult to decide whether eddie is so bad because it was so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it can t even get the cliches in a cliche ridden genre script right    the knicks coach who is eddie s antagonist early in the film reappears at the end   but he isn t given a chance to be the villain eddie desperately needs    neither is frank langella   and none of the athlete actors have the ability to give whoopi goldberg anything to play off of    that leaves her to do her street wise miss thang routine   but with no character   no sharp lines and no help    eddie isn t just a bad movie with a formulaic premise    it s a movie that makes you feel cheated and offended   because someone came up with a poster and a marketing plan to which they had to attach an actual movie   and you had the nerve to believe it was going to be a comedy    

Neg, where do i begin    okay   how about with this   starship troopers is one of the worst movies to hit theaters in a long time    in fact   it might even be the worst * major * release film to come out in years        or even a decade    this is bad beyond belief    i would * not * suggest paying money to see this    there s a good chance you ll regret it    if you see it for free   you could still want to walk out    go right ahead    the movie starts off with cheesy 90210 scenes set in the future world of       buenos aires    here we meet the group of horrendously bad actors and actresses playing obnoxious   easy to  * despise *  with a passion characters that have love triangles   love rectangles   and love hexagons screwing up their life    before long they all go off and join the military   primarily in the interest of having sex with the other youngsters that joined    they train    they strut around nude for no reason whatsoever    after an hour of making the audience scream in agony   they start fighting bugs    the big bugs look nice   even though their design is only   okay      unfortunately   the fights are boring since we * want * all of the characters dead anyway    cue more agony    then some characters have sex    then some more die     * * * who cares       * * *  cue more agony    the movie ends   the audience runs out to their cars   vomits over the pavement   and attempts to drive home    unfortunately   after that torture   they can t think straight   don t pay attention to the road   and many are in ugly car wrecks    you remember how batman & robin was bad    well   batman & robin kicked this movie s sorry butt   people    starship troopers does not succeed as an action movie    it does not succeed as a drama    it does not succeed as a war movie    it does not succeed as a comedy    it does not succeed as a satire    it does not succeed as a parody    it succeeds as being horrible    terrible    gut wrenchingly bad    i wanted to run away from that movie every minute    but i paid my money and i owed it to others to see if the movie got any better    so i stayed    it never got better    frequently   it did the impossible   and got * worse *    the movie as written   acted   directed   and basically just feels as a whole like it s about on the mental maturity level of a free willy 4   the whole thing feels like a movie that only three year olds could enjoy        except for the ridiculously gratuitous blood and gore   and pointless nudity    it s written for little children   but children should definitely * not * go anywhere near it    of course   i recommend the same for everyone    don t go anywhere near it    verhoeven s got a streak going now    his last movie was showgirls    he seems to be trying to see how bad his movies can get before people finally stop coming    showgirls was a failure   but it appears that   though it ll be lucky to make near its budget   this movie will still do okay gross wise    is it really * all * bad    well   no    troopers has about four or five lines of dialouge/short humorous scenes that are actually funny   mostly from the   do you want to know more      commercials that pop up throughout the story   promoting the joys of the joining the troopers    so that adds up to about 30 seconds of entertainment and still about one hour   59 minutes   and 30 seconds of miserable torture    i m totally confused as to the way that some people are really enjoying this movie    but i do admit it    so   if you re willing to possibly put yourself through torture   go ahead and see it   and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it    i don t know how anyone or any * thing * could love this movie   but hey   to each his own    feel free to give it a shot    of course   in the interest of saving your souls   i don t recommend it    but guess what    alien resurrection comes out november 26th   and   having already seen some of it and having read the script   i assure you that it will blow pretty much everyone away    though opinion on starship troopers is reasonably split   it ll be difficult to find someone that * won t * like alien resurrection when they ve seen it    this is possibly the year s best intense action film   or at least * one * of the best    if you really want to see alien warfare that s played out intelligently and seriously   see alien resurrection    please   avoid this    

Neg, american pie 2 is filled with laughs    but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for a locker room than a movie theater    i m no prude and i admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the 1999 hit comedy    but the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment   not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself    what separates american pie 2 from its predecessor is heart    of the original   i noted it was   a warm   pleasant outing about the travails of growing up      well   the quartet of chums   jim   jason biggs     oz   chris klein     kevin   thomas ian nicholas   and finch   eddie kaye thomas     have grown up    at least they are a year older   but don t seem any wiser    fresh from their first year of college the quartet   along with the obnoxious stifler   seann william scott     rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score    as usual nothing goes right until the last reel    but what we are left with is five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women    and american pie 2 is rather degrading to women    for the most part   they are not shown as individuals    they are nothing more than potential recipients of over active   raging hormones    it is telling that the most normal couple   oz and heather   mena suvari   spend the bulk of the film trying to have phone sex   she s overseas on an exchange student program    despite having been to college   jim is still klutzy and awkward   unsure of himself around the opposite sex    most of the pratfalls and humiliations are heaped upon him   including a painful episode involving an instant glue like substance    also uncomfortable to watch is a sequence involving three of the lads with two young women roommates   whom the boys suspect of being lesbians    it is offensive and plays upon outdated   adolescent stereotypes to generate laughs    the first film   despite some raunchy moments   had an innocent charm to it    the sequel is more cynical    it knows what its predominantly male audience members want and unabashedly gives it to them   the many mentions of finch s encounter with stifler s mom becomes a tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levy s return as jim s well meaning   trying to be hip dad    the only performer who is actually given some new   fresh material is alyson hannigan as michelle   the band geek from the original    in the sequel   she imbues her character with vulnerability   wisdom and maturity    american pie 2 is a pre sold commodity that will earn several million at the box office    it is a shame   though   that in its rush to rake in some bucks screenwriter adam herz   who also penned the original   could not have set his sights higher    american pie 2 is funny   but it s still a comedown as well as a letdown    

Neg, midway through   anaconda     documentary filmmaker terri flores   jennifer lopez   turns to a co worker and says   i thought this movie would be my first big break    instead   it s turned into a disaster      truer words have never been spoken       anaconda   is a monster movie with a lousy monster    it s a suspense film that is utterly predictable    it s a mess the film does manage to drum up some scares   but only in the most elementary way   like a jack in the box    as you turn the crank   you re totally aware that the damn clown is going to pop up   but somehow it s still mildly startling when it happens    the main difference between the giant snake in   anaconda   and the clown in a jack in the box is that the clown is more realistic       anaconda   boasts some of the worst special effects to appear onscreen in years    animatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe  inducing robots you ve endured at disney world    but it s the computer animated scenes that truly expand the meaning of the word lame    in one shot   a character tries to flee from the monster by diving from a tree near a waterfall   but the giant snake springs out and loops around its hapless victim in mid air    the scene   if done well   would have been a jaw  dropper    here   the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than a saturday morning cartoon    what s really amazing is that the filmmaker s were so proud of this dreadful shot that they actually included it in the promotional trailers for the movie    but enough about the phony snakes    now it s time to talk about the lousy story    heroic and very pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads a documentary film crew down a brazilian river in search of the shirishama indians   a legendary tribe that supposedly lives in the boondocks of the rain forest    stoltz tells his crew   pray that you didn t forget your bug spray      apparently the female crew members bathed in the stuff   because they spend most of the film wearing skimpy tops and short shorts with no ill effect    along the way   the group rescues a whacked out lapsed priest   jon voight   who claims to know how to find the shirishama    within minutes   they throw away all their plans and follow voight down a tributary into the land of creepiness    from that point on   the film is a hodgepodge of scenes and shots ripped off from   jaws   and   dead calm      one of the oddest structural points of the film is the handling of eric stoltz    early in the story   his character gets knocked into a coma by a river insect and spends virtually the rest of the movie unconscious    so why did they hire an actor of the caliber of stoltz for what amounts to a cameo appearance    also   why did stoltz   who generally selects his roles with great care   agree to appear in this crap    ah   the mysteries of hollywood    the remaining crew members are basically just snake food waiting to happen    jonathan hyde is mildly diverting as a pompous englishman hired to narrate the documentary   but lopez and ice cube manage to rise above their cardboard characters    lopez   who starred in   selena     is an enormously appealing performer   possessing a vibrancy that makes even the most trite lines seem credible    ice cube has a special charisma   an ability to look like a macho adult and a frightened boy simultaneously    there s also a special twinkle in his eyes   as if he s gently mocking his own tough guy posturing    but the movie really centers around the outrageously hammy performance of jon voight    obsessed with capturing one of the giant anacondas   voight plays the villain in thick accent   with a series of leers and hisses   spouting the kind of dialogue usually heard only in episodes of   jonny quest      at one point   he looms over the crew and says   the anaconda is the perfect killing machine    it strikes   wraps around you   holds you tighter than your true love    and you get the privilege of hearing your bones break before the power of its embrace causes your veins to explode       that moment is so high camp that it almost made the film tolerable    almost    fans of the horror genre may be tempted to check out   anaconda      don t    there are a lots of horror films scheduled for release this summer   including another   alien   sequel    wait for them   rent   jaws   in the meantime   and don t throw away your money and time on drivel like this    

Neg, well lets see       i m  not quite sure how to review this film   based on its laughter factor    well yeah i can   it s not funny    ok so i laughed one time which warranted the 1/2 star   but other than that i sat in my seat wondering when this pos would be over     which at a running time of 107 minutes seemed like forever !      in fact   this could be the un funniest movie i ve seen in a long time   if not the un funniest    let me be the first to say   ready to rumble   is a huge disappointment    long time wrestling lovers   david and scott   dream of making it to the wcw   and watching jimmy king wrestle    that is their hero of course   whom is kicked out of the wcw    well here is where the plot thickens   lol     the two wish to rescue the king   and put him back into the wcw but not that easily   because they are being tampered with by many people who are out to get them   while david s father wants him to become a police officer   and scott is a loser who has to with the help of david clean out johnny on the spots    what a plot eh       ready to rumble   is one of those films that tries to be funny   but sadly fails miserably   everything in the film is imcomprehinsable   and even the trailer wasn t funny    the actors are dull   the script awful   and the plot which there isn t much of         really  annoying    i m not quite sure how great actors like these   and very funny actors too   are given such a lame script   and directed in such a childish manner   that i wonder if hollywood is ever gonna make good films these days    this review isn t going to be very long because of the fact that there isn t much going for the film   if anything at all    only one big laugh is in the film   which isn t all that hilarious    i sat in my chair wondering with this 107   ! ! ! ! !    minute   comedy   was going to be over   and sadly it went on forever    i m not sure if anything could have saved this film from being such a total waste   but believe me you   it is    reviewed by brandon herring 4/29/00 for more reviews please visit movie review central at http   //www   geocities   com/moviefan983/moviereviewcentral   html  

Neg, 1989 s   major league   was a delightful surprise    i didn t expect much of it when i decided to watch it on cable   but it proved to be fresh and funny    however   when the appeal of a movie is its freshness   the sequels are virtually guaranteed to be stale    that s certainly true of   major league ii   and the most recent entry     major league   back to the minors      the title is   of course   a contradiction    shouldn t it be   minor league      that contradiction suggests the lengths to which writer/director john warren has gone to squeeze a third movie out of the formula established by the first movie    original stars charlie sheen and tom berenger   who returned for   major league ii     are not around   leaving corbin bernsen the only original headliner to make the third movie    the other veterans who return   dennis haysbert as voodoo inspired batter cerrano and takaaki ishibashi as tanaka   who was introduced in   league ii     seem to be around just to lend legitimacy to the enterprise    the only returning cast member who produces any laughs is bob uecker as radio announcer harry doyle   inexplicably broadcasting the games of a minor league team far from his home turf    the protagonist this time around is retiring pitcher gus cantrell   scott bakula     who is hired by minnesota twins owner roger dorn   bernsen   to manage the twins  aaa team   the buzz    you can write the movie from here   he finds a group of misfits who need to learn how to play together as a team in order to win    there s a future superstar whose ego keeps him from growing   walton goggins     an ex ballet dancer   kenneth johnson     a broken down old timer   thom barry     twin outfielders both named juan   the difilippo triplets     and a couple pitchers with throwing problems   judson mills and peter mackenzie      along the way   gus picks up cerrano and tanaka   gus is supposedly an old teammate of theirs   even though he wasn t in either of the preceding films      sum total   none    the entire enterprise is artificial   and the cast is not ready for the hollywood majors    gus  antagonist is twins manager leonard huff   ted mcginley      leonard is a slimy   sniveling little egotist   and the twins are lazy   spoiled   and full of themselves       even watching the first movie i wondered why any real life team would lend itself to being caricatured in this manner      gus challenges leonard to a match   the buzz vs   the twins       wanna guess who wins         back to the minors   is a movie that has no reason to exist    there s hardly a laugh in it   the cast is weak   and the first movie left no room for even one sequel    

Neg, here s a rarity   a children s film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject   is there a god    done well   it could have been a gem among the wasteland of modern children s cinema    unfortunately   it isn t    with jumbled messages   and an unclear audience   wide awake was better left asleep    fifth grader joshua beal   joseph cross   is in the middle of a moral crisis    his beloved grandfather   robert loggia   has died   and joshua has begun a quest    he wants to find god   to discover why bad things happen    this religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents   dana delany and denis leary     but they do their best to cope with their son as he explores different religious faiths    at his catholic school   his favorite teacher   sister terry   rosie o donnell     tries to give him guidance   but this is a journey he must make on his own    meanwhile   he is having the most momentous year of his life    he has several adventures with his daredevil best friend dave   timothy reifsnyder     he gets his first crush   and begins to wake up to the world around him while he is on his spiritual journey    it is somewhat confusing as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be    on its surface   it appears to be a kid s film    however   it deals with serious issues   and is likely to be boring for today s instant gratification kids    and while it might seem heartening to see that someone is trying to produce something thoughtful for the kidvid audience   wide awake asks serious questions   but only delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer    if there were a bit more meat in the story   adults on a nostalgic bent might get a kick out of the movie    the actors who might have created a great cast   o donnell   leary and delany   are wasted in roles that amount to little more than cameos    the nostalgic elements   best friend   favorite teacher   first crush   etc     have been done much better in other movies   and actually seem more like filler here    the film s strongest scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshua s relationship with his grandfather    they show more depth than is present anywhere else in the movie    maybe the film would have been better if   instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks   it were set entirely during joshua s last year with his grandpa    it certainly would have been more entertaining    wide awake can best be described as a failed experiment    it starts out with noble aspirations   but never delivers on its promise    parents who do take their children to see this one ought to be prepared to answer some tough questions       that is if their kids aren t bored to death first    

Neg, they should have stuck to the promise emblazoned on the original movie s poster     no sequel      scary movie 2 is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor   and it is not because the wayans brothers   shawn and marlon doing the writing and keenen ivory behind the camera   don t try    what defeats them is the genre they have chosen to spoof    the first movie   an outrageous   low brow   savage satire of teen slasher flicks such as scream and i know what you did last summer   succeeded because of its take no prisoners attitude toward a type of film that was in vogue   familiar and popular    in scary movie 2   the filmmakers take on the haunted house ghost story format which   if you look at the grosses for such recent lame offerings as the respective remakes of the haunting and house on haunted hill   did not draw audiences nor enter the cultural psyche as did the various teen slasher series    scary movie 2 does start off promising with a wonderful spoof of the exorcist   featuring james wood in the max von sydow role and veronica cartwright lampooning ellen burstyn    of course split pea soup is the punch line   an overabundant amount   which offers the hope that the rest of the movie will be just as tasteless and excessive    but this pre credit sequence has nothing at all to do with the main action   which features the cast members from the original signing up to spend a weekend at a creepy haunted mansion as part of a university class project    some of the jokes are as scatological and offensive as in the original   but they lack that take no prisoners bite that raised scary movie to the heights of burlesque    scary movie 2 merely lurches from one lame sendup to another   offering weak spoofs of that nike shoe ad in which everyone does acrobatics with a basketball   and the films what lies beneath and hannibal   features that only faired adequately at the box office     john woo s mission   impossible 2 and charlie s angels    it is as if the wayans and their team of writers   at least seven are credited   just threw ideas in a blender and hoped they d coalesce    they don t    while the pace of the original left you breathless   the sequel moves with the speed of an 18 wheeler carrying two tons of concrete up a steep mountain road    you can almost hear the reels panting    scary movie 2 tries very hard to live up to its original   but it falls very short    it s a dissatisfying spectacle   a very weak sister of a very good movie    the really scary aspect of this sequel is how disappointing it really is    

Neg, vikings v   bears    no   this isn t the lineup for monday night football    rather   these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in   the 13th warrior     a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory    based on michael crichton s book   eaters of the dead   this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought    their strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword    luckily for the vikings   however   their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film    antonio bandaras is ahmed   a travelling ambassador    accompanied by his friend   omar shariff in a cameo     they eventually come across a small viking village    we see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude    they laugh heartily   revel in their arrogance   and sing songs of battles won    but their festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land    help is needed quickly    an elderly   fortune telling witch arrives    after a brief incantation   she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more   not of norse blood   are needed to ensure victory    personally   i always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity    nonetheless   12 men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th    the group then sets out to do the greatest battle of their lives    of course during their ride   ahmed becomes the target of fun for the other 12 burly viking warriors    but he ably shows that it s not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog    he is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings   but will his skills   and that of the group   be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside    it does not look promising    these creatures   resembling bears   are strong and have high morale    they are fearless and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies    they attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come soon    the warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their gods    they are ready to sacrifice their lives       this is a good way to die     says one of the fallen warriors    despite the larger than life battle sequences   i was unmoved by the entire experience    at many points   i was even confused    for example   somewhere in the middle of the film   a sub plot creeps up involving the prince of the threatened land    he seems to have an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during this crisis    however   the sub plot never fully materializes   and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion    there are other questions that i had   but the real problem was that the story   little of it that there was   offered no characters to love or hate    the leader of the viking warriors had the most charisma    however   banderas s role is completely underwritten and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so special    an entire rewrite of the ahmed character is in order    also   much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at night   which made battles very difficult to follow    i would have preferred more time looking at the viking culture and how their beliefs shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy    as it stands   the film manages more confusion than intensity    it would make thor cry    

Neg, this movie about two dysfunctional families never really gets off the ground   despite some good performances from a basically competent cast    eddie   sean penn   and maureen   robin wright penn   are a not so happily married couple down on their luck    living in rented rooms in the seedier part of an unnamed city   they spend what little income they have at the local bar   owned by shorty   stanton     eddie s best friend   and his wife georgie   mazar      maureen and eddie share an odd relationship marked by eddie s frequent disappearances    on his return   he promises her the world and professes his undying love    their manic reunions all too soon lead to new lows   as eddie disappears again    like a junky craving the next high   maureen suffers through the lows to reach the next high    their relationship is further complicated by maureen s pregnancy    she wants the baby and the father   but deep down seems to sense the inevitability of losing the latter    during one of eddie s absences   maureen is attacked by kiefer   her neighbor   who gets her drunk   with her cooperation   and then insists on intimacy    she leaves badly bruised and in fear of what eddie might do    not to her   but to kiefer    she lies about what happens to ensure that no harm will come to eddie as the result of his inevitable rage    he lashes out as she expects   and ends up in an institution for what he believes to be 3 months    but in reality is 10 years    during this decade   maureen divorces eddie and remarries a more solid and reliable individual   joey   travolta   in a small role      her life falls apart again when eddie is released from the institution and comes to find her    joey insists on bringing eddie into his home and making his wife choose between her husband   and father of two children   and stability   joey makes a good living   drives a cadillac   and they live in a large house in the suburbs   and the love of her previous life    she chooses her past   and sacrifices not only her new life but her old   by giving up her and eddie s daughter to joey      but the eddie that she knew is gone   replaced by a mere shell of the man he was    maureen is herself a mere shell   more an automaton than a woman    as if she had gone through whatever therapy and treatment eddie was given along with him    perhaps these two really do need each other and can find happiness   or maybe the lack of sadness   together   but the movie s denouement was not convincing    

Neg, kate   jennifer aniston   is having some problems    it appears the twenty eight year old is not happy with her slow progression up the company ladder   and her love life apparently leaves something to be desired    she learns that her problems are related   as the owner of her advertising agency   mr   mercer   kevin dunn     explains to her that her single status does not bode well with the company    her freedom would make her more likely to leave the company   taking clients with her    a solution presents itself in nick   jay mohr     a wedding videographer who kate meets through a coincidence and gets photographed with    kate s boss   darcy   illeana douglas     uses the photograph to fabricate a wedding engagement between kate and nick    kate is at first repulsed by the idea   but after getting immediate positive results   she pursues it    her first task is to convince nick to go along with her plan    the actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc      at a dinner with kate s bosses he will provoke a fight and they will break up    she meets nick to propose the plan    he accepts    kate s new status brings unexpected results in other areas    the office bad boy   sam   kevin bacon     who wouldn t give kate the time of day   now does    now that she is engaged   he pursues an affair with her   as doing so would destroy her good girl image   hence sam s sudden interest    things start to fall apart for kate   as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her   and does not wish to break up with her    after some provoking nick does oblige   but problems continue for kate    it appears sam is no longer interested now that she is available    or maybe kate does like nick   but   reconciliation   will force her to admit her lies to her employer    adding to her mess is the constant prying of her mother   olympia dukakis     who wants her to get married and settle down    there is a scene in this movie where jennifer aniston is   from the waist up   only wearing a bra    it made me chuckle because it is the only time in the movie when she actually wears one    there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer    it s like the director said  well   we know the story is formulaic and the performances aren t that great so   what the heck   let s show jennifer s assets as often and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the pg rating      quite frankly it s insulting    i don t think aniston is a competent enough actress to carry a movie    she did a decent enough job in ed burns    she s the one   because it was a smaller and supporting role   and she just doesn t deliver the goods effectively in this movie    her performance was not convincing    unfortunately   as far as romantic comedies go   this movie adds nothing new to the standard formula for these types of movies    the film is similar to   my best friends wedding   in a sense that the leading female character is actually quite vindictive and due her actions   gets no sympathy from me when things go awry    i didn t care for how quickly kate puts down nick s profession by explaining that videotaping weddings wasn t glamorous enough for her co workers    at least   my best friends wedding   changed the formula a bit and had a somewhat surprise ending    no such luck with   picture perfect      every plot occurrence can be spotted a mile away   including a couple that really made no sense    after everything kate had done to prove her loyalty to her company   why would she blindly throw it all away when she should have made sure that nick would even talk to her first   let alone consider a relationship    was quitting her job a prerequisite to making amends with nick    throw in the fact that i don t think nick and kate spent enough time together to even warrant that rash of a decision    i believe that kate liked him   but liked him so intensely that she was willing to throw her career away    i doubt it    and what of the ending scene at a wedding where the entire congregation feels it necessary to stop everything and stare at the couple    are mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in total strangers    well   i guess of the congregation consists of movie extras and the strangers are the movies two lead stars   then that would make sense    picture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron  kate                                                 jennifer aniston nick                                                 jay  mohr sam                                                 kevin  bacon mercer                                           kevin  dunn darcy                                             illeana  douglas rita                                                 olympia  dukakis  written by randy turgeon   february 26   1998    visit my movie reviews !  www   xtdl   com/~canran  

Neg,    have you ever heard the one about a movie so bad that it made a guy run out of the theatre screaming      obviously the producers at columbia tristar did not think that we suffered enough from the first installment   and so to finish us utterly   they have now released   urban legends   final cut      this is another   scream    like feature   consisting merely from the recycled materials of rip offs from the most pointless movies of all time    amy   jennifer morrison   is a film student who is attending a film school filled with uninspired film students who do not have a clue about what to do    but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious university s film program    where each year s best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize   a virtual one way ticket to hollywood success    she has a chance encounter with campus security guard reese   loretta devine     whose tale of a series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at a fictional thriller organized along similar lines    soon enough   fake    and real    blood starts to flow   and amy is being chased around by scary killer   while her cast and crew get slain   one by one    is the culprit the original urban legends murderer   just some random psycho   !  a member of the faculty   one of her competitors for the hitchcock   or is there something even more stupid going on    this is another one of those tiring   pointless teen slasher flicks   neither scary   funny   or interesting    it simply lacks the ability and the story to entertain    the body counts and screams continue to grow   as the weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly    in fact watching films like that after having watched   scary movie   is impossible keeping a serious face    several times i tried to prevent myself from laughing   without succeeding    and then i realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing    it s the same thing that has been told and told and told over and over again as if it was the revelation of the century    how many times must we tolerate the same clich   s that have haunted the slasher genre since its birth    it has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them    they are the most stupid   meaningless   predictable and soulless films in existence    however   director john ottman manages to make   urban legends   final cut   into one of the worst achievements of this godforsaken genre    what was done with a sense of redemption for past failures and irony in   scream     ottman takes seriously    for that reason alone   it is worth a look   just to realize how bad a movie can be    it s tough to find comparisons for such an achievement   and we have to dig in ancient history to find a movie that would match its intellect    even movies like   lost in space   and   mission to mars   seem spectacular in its shadow    we have not seen such waste of t !  ime and resources since   showgirls     1995      no matter how hard i tried to find positive elements in this so called production   i came up with nothing   except the way the killer was dressed    here i feel that i have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker and marie sylvie deveu   that have wisely replaced the well known scream mask with a very elegant fencing mask    jennifer morrison     stir of echoes     is all right   and the other actors  best achievement is keeping a straight face when pronouncing the words from the script    in fact the only thing that is terrifying about this film   with the exception of its screenplay   is its portray of film schools    if these graduates will be the directors of the future   then hollywood s golden days are over    rumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing a third installment    let s just hope and pray that it s just an urban legend    

Neg, so much for sweet returns    after smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploitative 80 s slasher movies   starting with 1996 s   scream     and followed by   scream 2       urban legend     and the original     i know what you did last summer     a film like     i still know what you did last summer     was bound to be made sooner or late    it is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out   and that is because they reached for the lowest common denominator in filmmaking   favoring non stop deaths and gore for suspense   and trading in fleshed out   likable characters for one dimensional nitwits    it has been exactly one year since julie james   jennifer love hewitt   suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis   a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends and she accidentally hit in the middle of the road   and then   thinking he was dead   dumped him into the ocean    since then   julie has relocated to boston university   and although often paranoid and haunted by bad dreams   she has been able to put her life back together    when julie s friend   karla   brandy     is called up by a radio station and answers correctly what the capital of brazil is   she wins a vacation to the bahamas for four people   which also includes karla s horny boyfriend   tyrell   mekhi phifer     and will   matthew settle     who karla sets julie up with after her own boyfriend   ray   freddie prinze jr     also returning from the original     doesn t show up    when they reach the secluded island   they discover it is the last day of the open season   and will be stranded there for the 4th of july weekend with a few employees to fend off a violent storm headed for them    of course   julie   her friends   and the workers aren t the only ones there   as the murderous ben willis   dressed in fisherman garb   returns to seek revenge on julie once and for all    it is a sad state of affairs when a movie like     i still know what you did last summer     is made    i am a very big fan of horror movies   and so it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to   ikwydls     which i am a fan of   is almost an exact replica of a   friday the 13th   movie    while the original focused more on the story and characters   as well as genuinely suspenseful moments   thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson   who didn t return to write the sequel   and it shows       i still know          has no story to speak of   and is so vacuous of ideas   that the filmmakers   were forced to have a murder occur every five minutes just to keep the audience interested    also gone are any signs of character development   and since every single character died before i got to know them   all i was left with was to stare at the screen   indifferent to what was going on    while i cared about the fates of the characters in the original   it made no difference to me in this sequel who lived and died    they were all paper thin and pointless   except to become victims to the lethal hook of the fisherman    another element that made the original so memorable were some superbly crafted set pieces   like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar   but there are none to speak of in this sequel   although they do come close at one moment with brandy      since so many people were killed every couple minutes   the suspense and scares evaporated faster than salt in water    also of note is the mystery of the second killer   and accomplice to ben   but it is obvious from the first frame who it is   and so i couldn t even have fun at that   like i did in the   scream   movies and     urban legend      it figures that just as slasher films were starting to get some recognition again   a film would come along and ruin it for everyone else    maybe the people who made     i still know what you did last summer     should have realized that in order to make a good movie   you must have a screenplay   or at least one that isn t such a black hole for thoughts and ideas    the ending of the film inevitably leaves the door wide open for a third part   but judging from this amazingly lackluster first sequel   everyone involved should have quit while they were still ahead    

Neg, this was the last carry on movie   if you discount  carry on columbus  as a carry on movie   and was made by a new production company    based in central london   this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert   suzanne danielle   to bed her husband emile the french ambassador   kenneth williams      when he seems unwilling   she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes   such as the prime minister and the u   s   ambassador    her antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages    she is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead    meanwhile   theodore valentine   larry dann   is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her    however   she is only interested in restoring her husband s ardour which seems a little difficult after emile s accident with a church spire !  this film is the second worst carry on movie   the worst being  carry on england     it is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written    newcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid   as mrs   valentine   are mildly funny   but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad    kenneth williams only appears in a few scenes and his lacklustre performance is warranted   given the script    the small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler   joan sims as mrs   dangle   kenneth connor as leyland the chauffeur   and peter butterworth as richmond   are worthless and embarassing    in fact   all four parts are surplus to requirements    however   the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades    an awful script   a terrible collection of jokes   very poor production values   especially the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st   james palace     a ludicrous and cringeworthy musical score   and a non existent plot or storyline    its just a succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle will bed next !  jack douglas is not so annoying but is more boring   joan sims and peter butterworth are wasted   and kenneth connor and kenneth williams put in some poor performances as leyland and emile    a complete waste of time   this movie was trying to catch up with the new sexually permissive seventies    it was a certificate 15 film but by 1978   there was little interest in this kind of film and it flopped at the box office and was only given its premiere on uk terrestrial television in april 1998 !  avoid at all costs !  

Neg, i feel sorry for the financial backers of   waterworld     which is supposedly the most expensive film ever made   at $172 million !     and is also one of the stupidest   boy did they get ripped off !  in fact   this film is not really a movie   but more of an amusement park ride with a plot    it s not even just another case of cliches strung together   well   it is that too     it s something that s painful to watch because it relishes in its flaws    kevin costner stars as a man who is some kind of mutant half man/half fish    he is an explorer/mariner on an alternate earth that is completely covered by water because the polar ice caps melted    he s referred to as the mariner   but they   the meaner   would have been a more appropriate title because he s cold   rigid   and strict   and he s supposed the be the good guy !  he docks at a small floating village of sorts    he trades dirt for money and this introduces us to the other important characters    first we meet one of the villains   then the soon to be heroine   a child prodigy   a wacky inventor   and a group of primitive people that somehow have some of the technology we have today   but also some of the low tech tools used by pirates and vikings    immediately the film s biggest flaw is apparent   are these people primitive or highly advanced    it doesn t seem like anyone can read yet they have ski doos and airplanes !  how are these things powered    and if they have airplanes   couldn t they just keep flying until they reached dry land    also   if the planet is completely covered in water where did they get the materials to make these things    i m sorry   i m all for checking your brain at the door when going to the movies   but elements like these cannot go unnoticed because they draw our attention away from the story and confuse us    there was potential here for a good pirate story set in medieval times before modern technology   so why mix the two together    it doesn t make any sense    there really isn t much of a plot here because the story moves so quickly it never takes time to explain anything    the only thing we learn is that the prodigy child   enola   mojorino     has a tattoo on her back that is supposedly a map to   dryland      who put the tattoo there and how come it has taken them this long to figure this out    we never get an answer   just a stupid action movie about whoever can get the girl will be the victor of sorts if they reach dryland    to make a long   boring   stupid   and just plain bad story short   the mariner escapes with a woman named helen   tripplehorn   and enola    they sail for a long time   encountering some strange people in the process and fight off   the smokers   as lead by the idiot villain deacon   hopper     who kidnaps enola    the story becomes a overly grand adventure with the mariner taking on an army of goons   rescuing enola   and bringing them all to salvation   how original      even with all its special effects   action   and adventure this film is boring    not a single character is likable   therefore neither is the plot    dennis hopper completely rips off jack nicholson s joker   while costner just plain rips    still     waterworld   is professionally made with a good production design and an original idea but no substance to it    i just hope they don t make a sequel !  

Neg, what s to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornography  ie    the garbage known as   snuff   films    nothing   right    what s to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography    well       nothing    so   why make it   hollywood    there s no reason why the average   sane movie goer will be interested in such a topic    no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this    the lack of quality filmmaking in   8mm     from technical to acting   stands out even more when you consider the star   writer   and supporting cast  all reputable    but joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again !  like paul schrader   schumacher has his moments   but they re few and far   far !    between    basically   this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it    why not walk out    well   this wouldn t be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie    here s why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of   8mm          first thing  if you don t heed my advice   then understand what you re about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud    it s not easy to watch    i didn t know the details of the story beforehand   but at least my ignorance can help others now    the   ha !   plot revolves around tom welles   nicolas cage   as a surveillance expert and private investigator    a rich old woman discovers a   snuff   film in her late husband s safe    she calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl   it had to be a young girl   didn t it   schumacher !   who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead    she s horrified that her husband would have owned such a film   in 8mm   of course   and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find    family man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque   murder      let me backtrack for a moment    see     snuff   films are pornos with a violent twist  people are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead    however   the deaths are often staged and   in those cases   special effects and   good   acting make all the difference    very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard to find movies    the thought of this   industry   makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review   but i ll swallow my bile and move on    welles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry    you d think he s sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him !  he comes across smut clerk max   joaquin phoenix   who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze    after a lot of digging and bribing   welles finds the men who are responsible for making this   and other     snuff   films    skip ahead   skip ahead   skip ahead        led by dino velvet   peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance   and star torturer   machine     christopher bauer     they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue    the movie doesn t end there   unfortunately   because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films do  become a vigilante    this film doesn t draw you in    it keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close    it is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour   ie       se7en       but it takes a large measure of restraint   schumacher has none   and a larger amount of talent   schumacher has little      by those jabs   i m not only referring to his stylish destruction of the   batman   franchise   but   a time to kill   was an immensely overrated disappointment    for a guy who gets so much studio money   his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled    a good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter    writer andrew kevin walker didn t recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for  95s twisted thriller     se7en      director schumacher doesn t have that innate ability to make you watch things you don t really want to see like better directors are capable of doing    he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we don t see is more frightening than what we do   especially when it s a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered      however   gratuitous is joel s middle name    he must think that not flaunting a hard core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint    no   he doesn t go that far   but we see enough unpleasantness    he doesn t leave much to the imagination    it s manipulating to hurt   or kill   young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante    the script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters   yet schumacher has no subtlety in his   ha ha !    craft    case in point   a shot of a christian fellowship bus   good   right      drives away to reveal one of the villains   bad   right        see       no  subtlety    does joel think we re stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery    who do we root for in this mess    is there anybody out there    it s not all the director s fault   though    why did the actors sign up for this    nicolas cage is an oscar winner   for cryin  out loud !  if he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money   what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda    what is cage supposed to be in this movie  a whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears    villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy    and what is james gandolfini doing in this trash    he was so solid as a concerned father in   a civil action      i guess ol  nic   pete   and jim were promised a mountain of money       or  they re suckers    or they just don t care    there are moments   albeit brief ones   where this rises above the wasteland    catherine keener is good   although too quick to threaten divorce   as mrs   wells    baby cindy is obviously cute and wells  devout love of his daughter is sweet    the mother   amy norton   of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter    this film has an appropriate blue toned   washed out look like   payback     which was a much better movie      the editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue   but at other times it s rough    during some conversations   close ups and wide shots are not cut very well   making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts aren t good and whose timing was a half second off    such a technical error indeed stands out    speaking of standing out   don t believe the misleading trailers    there s not much action here    occasionally   yes   but not as often as your tv will have you believe    after seeing   8mm     i may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again    is that a positive    well   if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive   they ve done a swell job here    it ll be a long time before i give a schumacher film another chance  unless i lose my mind and become seriously depraved    but today i m not depraved   so i ask   why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it    i m sure that somewhere right now there s some pretty sick crap going on   but that doesn t mean i need to know about it    yes   mr   walker   your script tells us that there are some screwed up folks out there    yes   mr   walker   the proverbial monster doesn t look like we expect him to    you said all that in 1995    move on    this film serves no purpose    it doesn t entertain   it doesn t teach us anything   it doesn t make a statement beyond the obvious   this stuff is bad   approach    only if this film awakens the authorities to find a way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile    that s not likely to happen   though   so   8mm   is indeed a scummy waste of money    orson welles said years ago in a tribute to film     to movies       to  good movies      if only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in a hole    like   snuff   films     8mm   should never have been made    now   excuse me while i go try to forget i ever saw it    useless trivia  joel schumacher loves the vigilante theme    he used it in   batman forever     in   batman & robin     in   a time to kill     in   falling down     and it s rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow        

Neg,    what s your favorite new york moment         this one s climbing the charts      starring john cusack   kate beckinsale   eugene levy   molly shannon    directed by peter chelsom    rated pg 13    there s no doubt that 95% of romantic comedies follow a distinct pattern   guy sees girl   guy wants girl   guy goes through unreasonable obstacles to get girl   guy gets girl    in rare cases   the genders are flipped    predictability is a given    rarely   though   is a romantic comedy as cheap   as obvious   or as pointless as serendipity   a film that uses its   theme   as an excuse for its plot contrivances       lightweight   doesn t begin to describe it    this is like anti gravity    it begins in a new york city bloomingdale s   a product placement that rivals cast away s fedex for sheer blatancy    jonathan trager   john cusack   and sara thomas   kate beckinsale   both go for the same pair of gloves    after going through the perfunctory motions   jonathan gets to keep the gloves and the two of them go out for ice cream   followed by ice skating    jonathan falls hard   and sara is charmed    when she writes her name and number down on a piece of paper   a truck rumbles by and blows it out of her hand    she takes this as a sign from fate that they shouldn t be together   jonathan is flabbergasted    to pacify him   she comes up with an idea   jonathan will write his number on a 5 dollar bill   which she will promptly spend    when she gets home   she will write her name and number inside a book     love in the time of cholera     and sell it to a used bookstore    if the bill gets back to her or the book to him   it will mean that they are meant to be together    three years later    both sara and jonathan are now engaged to other love interests    both realize they aren t content    both go looking for the other    what happens now is so absurd that i m almost tempted to recommend the film for the sake of seeing it    the two of them run circles around each other in a set of incredible   coincidences   that i would describe as contrivances if it weren t for the film oh so cleverly dismissing that criticism by building its plot around   serendipity      of course   since the movie is about fate   the screenwriter can do anything he damn well pleases    i m not buying it    there s no suspense in any of this because we know exactly what s going to happen   but serendipity insists on drilling its purportedly   adorable   non story into our heads    instead of   will they meet      the question we re asking is   when will they meet already      to make matters worse   every   coincidence   is telegraphed from a mile away   by the last reel i was bored enough to actively look for signs that something else   incredible   was going to happen    cusack is fine and beckinsale   at least   isn t saddled with another lumbering   clunky screenplay   she s had bad luck   what with brokedown palace and pearl harbor on her resume     just an inanely pointless one    serendipity also relieves the tedium with the amazing eugene levy   who plays a snarky bloomingdale s salesman    what s the interest in watching a movie that spirals around and around a predestined   no pun intended   conclusion    serendipity wants to tug at the heartstrings   but it only tests our patience    

Neg, kids today   they don t just want to see heartthrob and master thespian freddie prinze jr   loving on the ladies    no   they want to see him doing something that takes a little more in the acting department   namely   playing baseball    through a series of drippy voiceovers   we are informed that there s no better proving ground for major league baseball than the cape cod summer baseball leagues   where college also rans and hopeful dropouts go to play in the hopes of attracting big league attention    our man freddie has landed a spot as a pitcher on the prestigious chatham a s   where he is hoping for his big break    it s only after he is given ample time to show off his abs and scamper about in a woman s thong   don t ask   that we learn what the real story of summer catch will be   that prinze is a poor townie named ryan dunne   struggling to make a name for himself   that neither his father   fred ward   nor brother   jason gedrick   pulled themselves out of their blue collar jobs and resent anyone who tries   and that the local beauty tenley    tenley !     jessica biel      is so far out of his league that he probably shouldn t even bother        but of course he makes a play for her    summer catch also makes an abortive stab at another half a dozen subplots    the jealousy of fellow townie and brazen slut dee dee   brittany murphy     the alienation felt by ryan s non baseball playing best friend   gabriel mann     or the fat chick fetish of fellow player miles   marc blucas      worst of these is a ludicrous bit involving that  70s show s wilmer valderrama and beverly d angelo   both of whom appear in the film simply to provide a nutty mrs   robinson like substory and to remind you of how much better done that was in bull durham    in fact   virtually all of summer catch feels like it s been done better somewhere else    for starters   the film has a major question of identity    it s definitely not a sports movie   and it fails pretty miserably at being a romance    the worst part is the amateurish script   co written by an arli$$ writing alumnus and a guy that starred in leprechaun 3     chock full of phony emotion    by the end   it all becomes a platform for each character to deliver a soliloquy to ryan that he must take to heart    dad is on hand to give fatherly yet drunken advice    coach   brian dennehy   just loving the fact that he s got some work on the big screen   is on hand to give the curmudgeonly counterpoint    ryan s catcher   matthew lillard   playing himself again   is on hand to tell ryan to   play catch   with him and make fun of the fat fetish guy    ryan s stoner best friend is on hand to give the go get  em tiger we re behind you talk    and the girlfriend is on hand to give heartwarming nuzzly follow your dreams counsel    before long   you start to wonder   is freddy prinze jr   is capable of having a thought of his own    don t answer that    the only real joy in the film is found in biel s character   and not just because of the skimpy outfits   which are also usually wet    she s the only one in the movie that is able to do much with her role   taking the rebelling against daddy character to at least a passing grade    when she s on screen   the time flies by    when she s not   you realize that for some ungodly reason this movie is almost two hours long    for a pg 13 teen romance   despite near constant sexual innuendo     one has to ask warner brothers   what were you thinking        for her part   biel has fallen so far from her 7th heaven roots that she has almost become denise richards    hollywood is either about to eat her alive        or vice versa    either way   good luck   jessica    as for freddie   if he keeps pumping teen romances out at the rate of two a year   prinze s next   summer catch   is liable to be a venereal disease    

Neg, it seemed like the perfect concept    what better for the farrelly brothers   famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter   than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality    it s exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish   poking fun at something serious   in this case mental illness     throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh    jim carrey s signed on too    even better    the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers  new film before its opening   claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality   labeling it incorrectly as   schizophrenia     and so forth    such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would   of course   only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers  fire   proving that some people just couldn t take a joke   and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy    yes   it all seemed perfect   but one thing went wrong   their movie isn t funny    it s not for lack of trying    the farrellys utilize in   me   myself & irene   their most high concept premise ever   carrey plays charlie baileygaites   a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver   decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them    this   of course   means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too forgiving nature   making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult    soon enough   charlie s repressed aggression manifests itself into a second   independent personality named hank   a deep voiced   boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster    this guy isn t above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he s been insulted   or holding a little girl s head underwater because she refused to stop jump roping in the street    then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted   and the film runs off its tracks    some have suggested that this isn t a problem   because the farrelly brothers  brand of humor doesn t require plot to work    they re wrong   of course   plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys  last effort   1996 s   there s something about mary         1999 s   outside providence   was technically an earlier project      the brothers  earlier film wasn t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags   despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe     but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected    in   mary     the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight of hand trick   they d have you thinking the story was going one way   then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion       me   myself & irene     by contrast   seems to have been made by folks who looked at   mary   and saw only the surface grossness   missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work    having been produced by the same guys who made   mary       irene   seems like an even bigger disappointment    the brothers pile on the offensive humor   taking shots at race   midgets   albinos   mental illness   and all manner of bathroom jokes    but they haven t come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of   me   myself & irene   comes off as rote   by the numbers   adolescent comedy    the plot   with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p   waters   renee zellweger     who s in more trouble than anyone knows   back to new york   has an ending that s entirely predictable from the get go       think charlie and irene will fall in love    yeah   me too      the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters   and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven t already expected them to do   no matter how outrageous their actions might be    compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing   this stuff is almost entirely soft tossed   presenting an obvious problem   when gross out humor loses its shock value   it s no longer funny   merely gross    the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry    take   for example   the subplot involving charlie s three black sons   anthony anderson   mongo brownlee   jerod mixon      the incongruity of it all is funny for a while   with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too pleasant smile on his face    but by the end of the film   they re still doing the same schitck it hasn t been elevated to another   funnier level   and it hasn t been dropped either    that s too bad   because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through       me   myself & irene   reeks of wasted opportunities    there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie s new personality   and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank s actions    this doesn t really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie s condition early on   so they don t have any opportunity to be surprised by it    the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point   involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called   appropriately     whitey       but the script doesn t go anywhere with it   instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax    jim carrey is a gifted comedian   both physically and vocally   but he s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in   all of me      it s a great showcase of flexibility and split second role shifting   but none of it is terribly funny    carrey doesn t pull any stunts we don t expect him to pull   and the farrellys  script doesn t give him anything else to pull   the situations in which he must perform the role shifting aren t set up in any meaningful way    perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better    zellweger s irene is not a strong female lead mary in   mary   may have been part adolescent fantasy   but she was also intelligent and strong willed    irene is nothing in particular   as the film never makes clear whether she s ditzy   clever   or neither    as such   she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only   sane   person in the film    chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent   and his character is entirely too straight laced for a movie like this    he   like the others   does absolutely nothing unexpected    after viewing the shapeless mess that   me   myself & irene   eventually dissolved into   i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves    maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked    but i don t believe it    good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style    if the farrellys are indeed good   smart filmmakers   and i still think they are     they ll rebound just fine    even after that happens   though   i ll still consider   me   myself & irene   to be a high caliber misfire    

Neg, senseless is a prime example of what can happen when you try to push a one joke concept a bit too far    director penelope spheeris is no stranger to this   having subjected audiences before to such tortures as the beverly hillbillies    marlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon   a college senior vying for a lucrative job at a prominent brokerage    however   he lacks the advantages of his chief opposition   scott thorpe   david spade   in the smarmy sort of role he can deliver in his sleep     an athletic record   sponsorship by a fraternity   and   most of all   a wealthy family to back him up    in fact   darryl has to work at four jobs simply to make ends meet    but there may be a light at the end of that tunnel    he signs up as a human guinea pig in a neurological experiment run by the university s dr   wheedon   brad dourif      as a result   his senses are magnified tenfold    using his newfound abilities   he sets himself in complete pursuit of the job   unaware that there may be some disadvantageous side effects to having super senses      naturally   marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle   giving jim carrey ish amounts of physical humor    the problem is   aside from a few genuinely inspired bits   there s not much that s funny here    the film has it s one central gag   and pads out the rest of its length with rather obvious lowbrow humor    there obviously wasn t much thought put into the plot    the entire job selection process is completely ridiculous    i mean   why the emphasis on extra curricular activities if the entire job is going to come down to a single elimination quiz anyhow    and is this the only job being offered to economics majors this semester    to give it credit   senseless does try to create a secondary joke with darryl s roommate   tim laflour   matthew lillard      apparently   he is supposed to be faddish   but the film never does anything with him   leaving him in a piercing phase throughout the movie    his   intervention   scenes with darryl   however   do provide a rare   and welcome   laugh    and then there s the love interest which is always pathetically tacked onto comedies like this one    in this case   the object of darryl s amor is janice   tamara taylor     a fellow student who won t have anything to do with darryl until he gains his super senses    needless to say   the romance is completely extraneous   and adds little to the film    this is a film that desperately needed something else    be that a good plot   more jokes   or simply funnier ones     or a strong character or two   anything would have helped senseless get off the ground    as it is   all the manic exuberant mugging in the world can t help marlon wayans get this one off the ground    

Neg, i have a confession    even though i am a movie junkie i saw eye of the beholder and yet i still watch movies i ve never seen any of the original godzillas       note that godzilla 2000 is not a sequel to the u   s   godzilla released in 1998   it s the american release of a 1999 godzilla flick called gojira ni sen mireniamu      so   part of me was excited as i drove to the local multiplex to see godzilla 2000 the latest entry in an almost 50 year old franchise    this was a long awaited treat    i was expecting a goofy good time   complete with bad dubbing   science fair level sets and a ludicrous plot line    the last thing i expected was for the movie to be so   boring    i can only imagine what the theatre full of kids i saw this with felt    you do get all of the   so bad they re good   traits so normally associated with the franchise    but you have to sit through a snoozer plot that has the organization of a rorschach blot    it s a deal i wasn t willing to accept    hiroshi kashiwabara and waturu mimura s script crams in way too many details   and in many cases   fails to follow up on them    the maneuver is not only disconcerting   but gives the movie a permanent logy   weighty feel    godzilla starts off destroying power plants and then just stops    was it a whim    a bold political statement    i don t know    its foe   an ancient meteor that looks like prudential s logo   doesn t just fight the beast from the far east    no   it s got to have life saving powers   a plot to erase   the data   from japan   a desire to clone and the ability to become a spaceship and then some kind of tentacled space creature    there s a battle between the head of the godzilla prediction unit   takehiro murata   and a slimy government official   hiroshi abe   over the handling of godzilla   and personal issues    and then there s the plucky news photographer and blah   blah   blah    it s like watching magnolia all over again except without the good writing   keen sociological insight and aimee mann songs    what a waste    when the talking and the plot points stop hurtling at you   godzilla 2000 does the job it s entertaining and goes down easy    the action scenes are cheesy in their grandeur though a little sluggish    the dubbing is nice and awful   with murata sounding like he s in constant need of a cough drop    as for the dialogue   one line summarizes the goofiness factor     did anyone see that flying rock go by      this movie also marked the first time since the three stooges that i ve heard the word   imbecile   used in casual conversation    though the summer movie season is drying up and godzilla 2000 has its moments   i wouldn t take kids to see it    they ll probably end up asking more questions than charlie rose    

Neg, after a marketing windup of striking visuals and the promise of star caliber actors   mission to mars ends up throwing a whiffleball    fiercely unoriginal   director depalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him    there are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind    the stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars    the astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo 13    interior spacecraft visuals are redolent of 2001   a space odyssey    instead of using these components as a launching pad to create his own movie   de palma stops right there   refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart    mission to mars takes it s first wobbly steps at a pre launch barbeque in which the perfunctory character introductions are done    during these surface scans of the characters   we learn that jim mcconnell   sinise   has lost his wife    it s a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety    the rest of the crew exhibit a bland affability    there is no contentiousness   no friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men and women being confined to close quarters for an extended length of time    maybe depalma was going for the comraderie of the right stuff   but in that movie   the astronauts had embers of personality to warm us through the technical aspects    it s the year 2020 and this is nasa s first manned excursion to the red planet    a crew   led by luke graham   cheadle     arrives on mars and quickly discovers an anomaly   which they investigate with tragic results    graham is able to transmit a garbled distress call back to earth    in response   earth sends a rescue team comprised of mcconnell   woody blake   robbins     wife terri fisher   nielsen   and phil ohlmyer   o connell      obstacles are put in the crew s way and and they matter of  factly go about solving them    i should say   mcconnell goes about solving them    time and again   mcconnell is presented as some kind of wunderkind   which wouldn t be so bad if the rest of the crew didn t come across as so aggressivelly unremarkable       mention should be made of the misogynistic handling of fisher in a situation where the entire crew s mission and life is in mortal danger    on a team of professionals   she is portrayed as an emotion directed weak link    women serve no purpose in the movie other than to serve as a reflection of a male character s personality trait      by the time they land on mars and try to solve the mystery of what occurred   mission to mars starts laying on the cliches and stilted dialogue with a heavy brush    there is an adage in film to   show   don t tell      mission to mars does both    repeatedly    characters obsessively explain the obvious   explain their actions as they are doing them   explain to fellow astronauts facts which should be fundamental knowledge to them    the film s conclusion is momumentally derivative   anti climatic and unsatisying    as i walked out i wondered who the target audience might be for this film    the best i could come up with is pre teen age boys   but in this media saturated era   this film s components would have been old hat even for them    i have to think what attracted such talent to this film was the lure of making a good   modern day b movie    the key to such a venture is a certain depth and sincerity towards the material    i felt no such earnestness    

Neg, synopsis   two con artists find the perfect patsy in harry   woody harrelson       an inept former journalist who trips and bumps his head into a post   tries to slap a girl and gets poked in the eye   has ill timed fits of coughing   and fails at everything he does    the story is told from harry s point of view    harry always carries around a shot of whiskey although he swears he doesn t drink    one day harry is approached by the con girl rhea   elisabeth shue     who is similar to harry in that she carries around a cigarette but swears she doesn t smoke    seduced   harry agrees to participate in a money making scheme involving faking the kidnapping of odette   chloe sevigny     the teenage daughter of a rich man    turns out   it s all part of a needless   very puzzling   extremely elaborate and convoluted scheme   it involves hiring special impersonators   by two cons in order to fool harry   a hero who barely has the intellectual capacity of a wooden post    when the  kidnapped  odette is found dead   the clues point to harry as the kidnapper/murderer   and the police are hot on harry s trail    harry suddenly realizes he has been framed while others have taken the ransom money    can he get out of this mess    opinion   palmetto is a long   uninteresting film with all the wrong feel    hero harry is an inept bungler who trips up often and consistently overestimates his own intelligence    this farcical kind of character works best in an entertaining naked gun action comedy or dragnet spoof    but palmetto is played like a dark   serious   detective noir drama   and watching harry s bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating distraction    there s a lapse in concentration in the middle of the movie as the camera goes wild on breasts   buttocks   short skirts   colored painted nails   and women s legs    even when the focus is supposedly on harry and his dilema   you can always notice the side of elizabeth shue s breast forming a prominent foreground    towards the end   palmetto re focuses on plot for the grand finale     a confusing explanation involving impersonators   with woody harrelson handcuffed and suspended over a tub of acid as he hears the criminals  confession    if you can imagine  shemp  from the three stooges playing the detective hero of an hbo  lingerie suspense  thriller   that s how out of synch this movie feels    

Neg, when i was nine   i started buying the coolest toy figures in my local department store    masters of the universe was the pinnacle of what i was after for action figures   they combined science fiction and fantasy   had cool names like mekanek and stinkor and each came with its own little comic book to read    of course   the animated series produced by filmation remains one of the most wildly successful television products in world history    given the tremendous success of the toys and the cartoon   not to mention its moderately successful spin off she ra   princess of power     it was inevitable that a production company would put two and two together   come with the result of   trillions   and make a live action masters movie    let s be blunt   masters of the universe is a very bad movie    the story is painfully dull and mind numbingly cliched   hands up who * wouldn t * guess he man and skeletor take their fight into the real world   and is acted out by either incredibly untalented actors   dolph lundgren as he man for one   or good actors   james tolkan   meg foster   given such awful characters and dialogue that they can t help but seem terrible    it is extremely clear that someone making the movie wanted it to be as good as star wars    we have the alien bounty hunters   the desert skif technology   stormtrooper lookalikes and a musical score so reminiscent of john williams that   deja vu   is too polite a term to use in describing it       blatant uninspired ripoff   would appear more appropriate    tv fans might want to check out courtney cox   monica in friends   and robert duncan mcneill   lt paris in star trek   voyager     very early in their careers and not doing to well in them either    so in the face of such mindless sub mediocrity   is there anything to make masters of the universe worth watching at all    yes   there is    one incredible good reason    his name is frank langella    langella has always been one of the underrated actors of hollywood   appearing in countless films over the years    here he plays skeletor   the villain of the piece    dressed in opulent black velvet robes and bearing a skull for a face   he is one part darth vader   one part emperor and two parts grim reaper    given this character   langella falls right into it with style and precision    skeletor is believable   interesting and manages to tread the fine line between being a homage to the past and startlingly original in his own right    masters of the universe    i remember loving it when i was eleven    at twenty one it s difficult to see why    but   as i said   it is blessed with a superlative villain who makes the entire thing worth the tedium of the remainder    besides   this year marks the film s 10th anniversary    watch it with some friends for a good laugh and celebrate    

Neg, battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000   and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close    in fact   i ll be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years    based on the novel by scientology guru l   ron hubbard   battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information    it s the year 3000   and an alien race called the psychlos   which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers   conquered our planet in nine minutes    ok   we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind    when were we conquered    the audience is led to believe that this happened about 1   000 years earlier   and if that is the case then we re going to get into a whole bunch of problems later   trust me        keep reading      also   why don t we get to see earth get conquered    how the hell do you make a popcorn sci fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film    humans now live as cavemen or slave labor   and for the film s first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver   colorado    they grunt and groan and babble about monsters    so   when the psychlos conquered earth   were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills    none of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered   whenever that was      this is definitely not the way to start an action/sci fi film    one of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster   and he begins to fight it    the   monster   turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course    he turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course   with some shrubs growing over them    so   in 1   000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time   with only a few weeds growing over it    anyway   some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl   john travolta   a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit    the cavemen   led by barry pepper   are forced to do their bidding or whatever   but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet   or something    so these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1   000 years earlier    and   we re supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who can t even handle a few cavemen    one of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos    so jets left unattended for 1   000 years are still able to fly    please   if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood    why did the psychlos leave jets around anyway    shouldn t they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us    the psychlos refer to humans as   man animals   but yet dogs are still   dogs      why aren t they   dog animals      the psychlos are after mining earth s precious resources   but for 1   000 years are unaware of fort knox    why do i even care at this point    i m a fan of travolta s and i m glad to see he s back on the a list in hollywood   despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon      but how did he possibly think this was a good movie    and how did he think he was giving a good performance here    he s more than capable of making a menacing villain   see broken arrow and face/off   but whenever his character came on screen i couldn t hold back my laughter    now despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have   travolta just looks like travolta    all of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face   but travolta just has a goatee    also   travolta s acts with a sort of phony upper class snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world    ooooo   scary villain    as a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better    you can make a dumb but good sci fi film   i love independence day for example     but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth    i did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening        i cleaned my glasses   walked around the theater   made a grocery list   chose my lottery numbers for the week   replayed super bowl xxv in my head   with commercials          and still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids    by the time we actually reach the year 3000   people should still be avoiding this film    folks   save your cash      don t go see it   don t rent it   and don t buy it    you d be more entertained by taking the money you d use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind   watching it sail away   hell   send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal        we ll entertain you plenty with that kind of money      unless of course you re just captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running   which is just about all you ll come away with from this movie    that   and a headache    [editor s note   for some reason though   the day after my screening i converted to scientology    i m not sure why        something just made me feel compelled make the choice   ]  

Neg, plot   lara croft is british   rich and kicks a lot of ass    she also likes to raid tombs but when the illuminata discover that all nine planets are about to stand in alignment for the first time in 5000 years   and that lara holds the key to time   well   needless to say   they want to nab it from her    oh yeah   lara also likes to sport a lot of tight shirts       hummana hummana hummana        critique   angelina jolie was great in this movie    there were also about three   action scenes   that were pretty cool to look at in this film    uhhhhhm   unfortunately the rest of the movie sucked !  bad dialogue   generic sidekicks and bad guys   a lame mystery   yoda esque moments with mumbo jumbo being sprouted about and even some crappy cgi near the end    all in all   this movie wasn t the horror show that some of the early reviews had warned us about   especially since every other scene does feature jolie s torpedoes begging to burst out of her lucky shirts   but it was quite the letdown nonetheless   especially when you consider the major opportunity that the filmmakers had here to create a cool   hip woman hero   based on a popular video game    i don t know   i guess you have to put most of the blame on director simon west   who didn t really tie the whole movie together all that well    the film lacked energy   a consistent pace and well       a  fun time !  i felt kinda depressed while watching this movie    all that   father   crap was horrible and the dialogue given to poor john voight to recite was just plain embarrassing   and i m not even gonna mention his moustache       hehehe      why have this shite in the movie at all   !    i especially hated the scenes in which some ghost like figure   friend or child would ramble on about lara croft s father while all the time   i m not giving one ounce of crap as to what they re talking about    i guess that s called lack of   character development     right    that s when a movie builds enough background into the characters on the screen   so that we could actually   get into   it and care about them    i didn t care about anyone in this movie   and was bored during most of its   let s explain why we re doing all this gobbledygook   moments    and even though i thought that jolie kicked some mighty ass   damn   did she look sexy blasting those guns or what   !       everybody else around her was so goddamn boring !  her butler was a throwaway with no personality   her side kick was supposed to be funny but just annoyed me every time he said the word   bugger     and he says it a lot   trust me !   and all of the so called bad guys just spewed one dimension !  they had no spark   no energy amongst them   and even though a few of the action scenes in the movie were cool   see the trailer and you ll know which ones i m talking about     the overall picture was lame and the dialogue and mystical bull crap just buried it even further    also   for a movie that s supposed to be about all of these exotic locations   i wasn t necessarily impressed by any of its exterior shots   and even less so with its interiors   which all looked like they were shot in the same room    mind you   i won t go as far as to say that it s the   worst movie of the year     remember that i actually have to go see freddie prinze jr   movies also !     but it s definitely the worst film that i ve seen during this summer movie season   of course   it s still early and i m sure there are a few more garbage heaps coming down the pike      skip this one altogether and rent any of the indiana jones movies instead       trust  me   you ll miss the boobs but end your night with some rock solid porn and it s all good !  where s joblo coming from    raiders of the lost ark   10/10     the mummy   8/10     lost in space   7/10     the mummy returns   6/10     the general s daughter   3/10     romancing the stone   7/10     wild wild west   3/10     mission impossible 2   7/10    

Neg, sometimes i wonder just what the censors are thinking    take this film     naked killer     among it s ingredients are heavy doses of violence   rape sequences   straight and lesbian sex scenes and what our system calls   coarse language      but what do those intelligent people at the censorship bureau choose to remove in case someone will get offended    one word   penis    that s it    in spite of everything else in the movie the one thing that the censors decide is too much is   penis        it really restores you re faith in the system   huh    anyway   that s just a side point    when naked killer was released in the local independent cinemas around melbourne   it was advertised ad nausuem as a hip   cool   controversial thriller    what they forgot to mention was that it isn t very good    the plot involves male cop tinam   simon yam     investigating a series of brutal murders    while getting a haircut he meets and finds himself attracted to a girl named kitty   chingmy yau     who   after extracting revenge on the man who killed her father   falls in with professional killer sister cindy   svenwara madoka      realising kitty has potential   cindy decides to train kitty in several unusual and ridiculous ways and gives her a new identity    however in the course of his investigation tinam   who believed kitty had disappeared     runs into her again   but isn t quite sure if it s her    to complicate matters the actual serial killlers   princess and baby   who a former students of cindy   and have been told to kill their old master and her new student    from then the action ensues        all in all   this is not a well done movie    the script is awful   the direction all over the place   the editing is jerky and confusing and the subtitling is surprisingly poor    however the are a few stand alone pieces that do entertain    the shoot out in the car park is almost woo like in adrenaline    the fight scenes are energetic and i guess it must get a few points for trying something a little different    let me put this way   if you like action   get something else   if you like strong women in movies   get something else   if you have do decide between this and   black cat   for your hong kong female action   don t get either    even for curiosity value it just isn t worth it    let s face it   if ever the was a movie that became popular on it s subject alone   this is it    

Neg, mr   bean   a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting    the first two words should have said enough to let you know what occurs during bean s trip to la   but if they didn t look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride    heck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick    either way look out america bean is coming    well   what can really be said about this movie   there is very little discernible plot    that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy    it achieves that goal rather admirably   but because it is that   the plot is just screaming for help    the whole premise that the movie is based on is to say the least flawed    the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad libbed as you went    don t go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece    but if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie   even if you don t like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because something s are just so stupid    the movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims   or so it seems    now when you look at the acting in this movie you have to think about two things   first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner    well   there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn t the easiest i am sure    i have to concede that mr   atkinson s acting in this movie is well done    although the role isn t too demanding the slapstick is    i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue   it would have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie    now the rest of the actors in the movie   bad acting and poor casting    i think that the role opposite bean could have been better   just seemed wrong for the movie    a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn t what was trying to be achieved    one thing that i must say   simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results    tv shows should do just that stay on tv   it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers    i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively   the best known of those would have to be star trek    bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved    now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly    the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people   these people will think like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless    but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie    but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie    there are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one

Neg, the best thing about     lake placid   is that it s only 80 minutes long and when it s over you re glad that you didn t waste more than an hour and a half of your time    it s nothing more than a bad rip off of     jaws     and i think that s being kind      it was written by david e   kelly     ally mcbeal     as a horror comedy but fails at both   miserably    i was never scared and i think that i only laughed once    the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in     anaconda      the plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine    that brings the local sheriff   brendan gleeson   and a fish and game warden   bill pulman   to investigate    also   a paleontologist   bridget fonda   from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentric millionaire/crocodile lover   oliver platt   flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast    soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it    there s also an eccentric old lady   betty white   who lives by the lake and has a few secrets    as i mentioned before kelley and director steve minor   h20   don t go for a serious approach towards the material but they also don t have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either    the betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting   they re all basically idiots    if they had any brains the croc wouldn t have been that much of a challenge to catch and they wouldn t have put themselves in half of the situations that they did    but then again   if they were smart there wouldn t be a movie    basically     lake placid   is best undiscovered    

Neg, isn t it the ultimate sign of a movie s cinematic ineptitude when you can t think of much to say about it other than   it sucks      one of the first official year 2000 releases   supernova is such a movie    i can t seem to get past one word adjectives with this one   although   boring       stupid   and   absurd   doesn t amount to much of a review    a shame    i would have been able to save myself the chore of desperately trying to elaborate    but c est la vie    here goes nothing    i ll keep it short    i suppose the first bad omen for supernova came when director walter hill   48 hours   removed his name from the movie   requesting that it be replaced with the pseudonym thomas lee    the film s fate was sealed in many minds when struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for the press   an event usually signifying a studio s lack of confidence in a particular movie    hill s and mgm s actions were prudent    when the captain of medical space vessel nightingale dies in a tragic hyperjump accident   a reformed drug addict who is also the first officer   for some reason   james spader   is forced to take command    the ship picks up a distress call from a nearby planet and   on arrival   picks up one survivor from an apparent accident in an abandoned mining colony    one of the crew members   angela bassett   knows this passenger   who is played by peter facinelli   and has some bad feelings about it    and we all know what that means    this intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo    a jellylike substance the purpose of which is unknown   though it seems to bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it    another one of the crew members experiences this first hand   after spending a few minutes partially inside this glob of goo   he does some impressive handstand pushups    evidently   touching this enigmatic egg shaped thingie makes you younger and stronger    how    why    the movie never bothers to explain    soon enough though   spader and bassett are running around the ship like mad   being chased by the all of a sudden superhuman facinelli    to be honest   i don t even remember exactly why    i just remember that i didn t care    supernova s plot suggested some more or less interesting ideas   such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic time bomb   but they are all dropped before they have a chance to develop into anything truly intriguing    in fact   everything is dropped just so the actors can have some fun running around what looks like an elaborate set    well   the effects are good   though there s hardly a studio movie with bad special effects these days so i m not sure whether that s so remarkable an accomplishment    the performances are hardly worth talking about    i m not even sure i can call what s here   performances     though angela bassett sure is good at giving people the finger    james spader is not a bad actor   but he proves to be one of the blandest action stars i ve seen in a while   mostly because he isn t given a character with a personality    the action scenes are just as bland   since they re pretty much just rehashes of action elements that weren t particularly entertaining the first time around    and since the action scenes are everything to this movie   it s pretty much dead in the water    and for the life of me   i can t figure out why it s called supernova    

Neg, according to the publicity material   with this movie the directors   hope to restore good old fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness      hmm    you never know   they just might be on to something    what with the rise of geek chic   lounge music and seventies fashion   the ever contrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own    but then   i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it    it s cheesy all right   but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch    that s a shame   because   in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more    woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise   roy munson    the movie opens in the fifties with roy s dad dishing out the reader s digest/gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls   shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever    the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray   as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken    it s thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good   he gives the wry   derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy    mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job   then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roy s hand    then it s fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat   balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand    he s hopeless until he meets ishmael   randy quaid     an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege    so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno   picking up pretty hustler claudia   vanessa angel   on the way    with the exit of bill murray   the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go   and that s        dumb and dumber    yes   indeed   kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour   peter and bobby farrelly   the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle    so   prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands   distended nipples   ridiculous hair and bull semen    get set for stock fish out of water situations when city boy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community   or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking   striptease and unchristian neighbour socking    now   don t get me wrong   there s nothing wrong with cheap humour   and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy    the trouble is that these jokes aren t bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction    it lurches from sports movie to amish mocking to road trip to sentimental melodrama     pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal   and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack     never quite getting it all together    some gags fall flat from a lack of build up   while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply don t do anything    why the long   unfunny fight in the car park    why two of these    why does that guy wear mascara   or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it    the film is full of these half thought through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer   grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying     wouldn t that be funny        well   no   actually    the actors don t do the movie much favours either    woody harrelson comes off okay   plausibly acting dumb   smart   cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it   but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham   and vanessa angel has no talent   like schwarzenegger   she seems more convincing playing a computer creation than a human    take the tv series weird science       please        even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movie s climax    all in all   a fairly useless attempt at comedy   and a certified no hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance    we ll have to look to a reinspired john waters   or perhaps somebody from down under     strictly bowling     anyone     for the definitive bowling comedy    the flying inkpot s rating system   * wait for the video     * * a little creaky   but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good   bring a friend     * * * * amazing   potent stuff     * * * * * perfection    see it twice    

Neg, starring kiefer sutherland   reese witherspoon & bokeem woodbine i used to think that the conversation was the worse film i had ever seen    freeway is giving me second thoughts    freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood    only in the nineties   little red riding hood is a foul mouthed juvenile delinquent played by reese witherspoon   and the big bad wolf is a serial killer   keifer sutherland      to top that pathetic premise off    reese goes to visit granny and you ll never guess who s waiting under the cover s in granny s bed    keifer sutherland is one of hollywoods most talented   yet underrated actors   and reese witherspoon is exceptionally talented and will most likely become a major star    so what are they doing in this movie    after seeing the end result   undoubtedly they are both asking themselves the same question    you might be asking yourself why this is such a short review    the answer is quite simple    i dont want to waste any more of my time writing or thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary    i wasted enough of my time just sitting through it    note to keifer   you wonder why you aren t a bigger star in hollywood    because you keep making movies like this    note to reese   you were great in fear   what happened this time    note to both   don t worry about it too much   no one saw this movie anyway    bottom line    i m still shaking my head    don t waste your time on this turkey    if you want to see a great keifer sutherland movie   go rent flatliners or young guns    reese witherspoon s abundant acting talents are used to their full potential in fear   a great thriller    do yourself a favor and rent one of these movies    but stay as far away from freeway as you possibly can    

Neg, ironically   one of the themes of 200 cigarettes is that you should try to make the best of every moment in life    unfortunately i will no longer be able to say that i lived every moment of my life to the fullest   because i spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes   watching this sad excuse for a movie    actually smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldn t be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie    not only is it a pathetically bad film overall   but 200 cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever    the plot is scattered   thin and predictable   the acting is monumentally bad   and the style of film making resembles a home video    it is december 31   1981 and the big party is at monica s   martha plimpton   house    but no one has arrived yet    her 8 invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups    some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica   and some are total strangers    but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night s end    those who are invited are the ones that have the issues    it is up to those who aren t to help them come to terms    first there is eric   brian mccardie   who is a former boyfriend of monica s and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance   or lack thereof    he is one of the most bland characters   in a film full of dullness   because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical   a common trait of this poor production    bridget   nicole parker   and caitlyn   angela featherstone   who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year s eve and tag along to the party with them    they stumble across a nameless bartender   ben affleck   who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections    he is nether sexually deprived   nor uncertain about his future   as he is in law school    his lack of flaws is both boring   unrealistic and painful to watch    as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub standard comedy    moving on   there is val   christina ricci   and stephie     gabby hoffman   2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts    val is monica s cousin and a true fan of the new york scene    on the other hand   stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can t find    paradoxically   it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar   actually they attempt to flee from their presence   but aren t successful   who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds    of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples   only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot    wisely   the movie s creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy   courtney love   and kevin   paul rudd   who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless    paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie   janeane garofalo   and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship    however   the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends   and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening    finally   there are the two worst performances and worst sub plot of the film    jack   jay mohr   and cindy   kate hudson   have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy s virginity the night before    while she attempts to play this down and be her usual self   he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy    very often   when a film is as putrid as this production   there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory    however   this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted    instead   what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts   bad continuity and inaccuracies    first   and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another   there is no apparent order that it follows   and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot    at other times   objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot    there are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish    not in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver    and yet   no matter how miserable this film may be   and no matter how poor the acting is all around   there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots    perhaps   if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or   perhaps   even three   there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development   or quality acting   or even a decent plot payoff at the end    but it didn t happen that way    the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance   and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight    

Neg, burnt money is the perfect festival film    it will show once or twice   and then no one   thankfully   will ever have to hear from it again    this film from the seattle international film festival 2001 s emerging masters series is easily one of the year s worst    billed as a gay `bonnie and clyde    this gritty film from director marcelo pi   eyro has its only highlight in a well designed title sequence    two gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery that makes a gang leader   whose plan they screwed up   angry    this causes the gang leader to send his boys out to get the gay guys   one of whom may not actually be gay    hiding out in a prostitute s apartment   the two men must fight off police and gang members in a very long showdown for the movie s conclusion    if caught   they risk losing all the money   and their love    as an added emotional bonus   one of the gay men is dying    or something like that    everything that happens is so quick and confusing i was completely lost    clarity isn t exactly this movie s striving virtue   so it was a little hard to pick up    not much could have really happened though    the main events in this long two hour film are explicit homosexual and heterosexual sex   graphic drug use   extreme violence   and strong language    lots of explicit material is never a bad thing when there s a reason   but there s no purpose to anything in this film    most of the sex and violence scenes come off as silly   while the heavy drug use comes off as ridiculous and depressing    it appears pi   eyro   who co wrote with marcelo figueras   from a novel by ricardo piglia   purposefully adds more blood and lovemaking for his own amusement    he makes the actors as sweaty and dirty as possible   makes them snort cocaine   gives them guns and condoms   and lets them go    burnt money is pointless    the performances are bad    it tries to thrill and shock   but only causes boredom    god forbid it will ever get a distributor    another disappointing film from this year s so called emerging masters series    pass on by    

Neg, in 1989   director edward zwick began his career with the powerful civil war drama     glory     but since then   he has made continuous disappointments   to me at least   with 1994 s   legends of the fall     and 1996 s   courage under fire      those two films weren t bad   just not very good   but with zwick s latest film     the siege     he has finally made one       the siege     is a modern day action thriller that focuses on terrorism that is sweeping through new york city    investigating the matter is fbi agents anthony hubbard   denzel washington   and frank haddad   tony shalhoub     who are first hit by the ordeal when a city bus explodes with several innocent people on it    later   a bomb goes off in a broadway theater   killing even more    they soon meet cia operative elise kraft   annette bening     who may very well hold the key to the identity of the arab terrorist    there are some movies that simply don t need to be made   and     the siege   may very well be one of them    oh   sure   zwick thinks he is making a   meaningful   action film   since he has added lots of exposition scenes in which the audience is basically lectured on the horrors of terrorism   but what he really has made is actually no more substantial than   say     die hard     which also starred bruce willis    this time   willis is horribly wasted as a general of the u   s   army   who puts a state of martial law over nyc during the climax    whatever points     the siege     earnestly tried to make   were obviously lost in the translation from page to screen   or maybe   zwick never really had anything serious to say in the first place    the role of the arab community is offensively stereotypical   just as women were in the recent     john caprenter s vampires     by placing them all in the category of   bad guys         the siege     contains three fine actors   washington   bening   and shalhoub   but washington is stuck with a character that contains not an ounce of even remote development    bening has slightly more to do   and has an intriguing character to work with   while shalhoub pretty much steals the show   even though   again   he has no real character    by the climax of     the siege     with washington giving a sermon to willis on the so called   message   of the story   i felt like i had wandered into a sequel to     on deadly ground     in which steven seagal gave a 10 minute speech at the end about preserving the environment       the siege   is constantly heavy handed   not entertaining or insightful   and just goes to prove that not even the best actors can save a film that lacks a satisfactory screenplay    

Neg, 2 days in the valley is more or less a pulp fiction knock off    it basically involves how a bunch of quirky characters in the los angeles area end up having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways    i m not going into much greater detail than that   since it would take forever to explain   and quite frankly   i m not willing to spend any more time on it than the 2 hours that i ve already wasted    while it tries very hard to be pulp fiction   2 days in the valley falls way short    this is quite a condemnation considering the cast includes danny aiello   james spader and jeff daniels    while the story isn t much   and the dialogue and characters rate only marginally better   2 days in the valley does have a couple of bright spots    james spader s character   while not much better than the rest   is at least fun to watch in a sick sort of way    and we do get to see a nice cat fight between uber babes teri hatcher and charlize theron   in her first role      you know a movie isn t that good when the highlight is a brawl between two women    even if they are both gorgeous    i will give the writers some credit for the fairly clever ways in which they managed to intersect the lives of this group of characters that would have otherwise never interacted    but marveling at that ingenuity is a far cry from actually enjoying the result    while some of the characters and their respective stories are fairly interesting   they inevitably are brought down as they intersect with the other half of the characters that i really cared absolutely nothing about    if i were to put a number on it   only about half of the story and half the characters in this movie were particularly interesting or otherwise enjoyable to watch    this is the sort of movie that only a huge fan of one or more of the cast members should rent   and even then prepare for disappointment    not even charlize theron being naked would get me to sit through this movie again    or at least not all of it anyway    

Neg, what would inspire someone who cannot write or act to pen and star in a movie    a better question   what would inspire a studio to produce said movie    if you have an answer   let me know    foolish   the new movie written by and starring master p is a jaw droppingly horrible film   one with no redeeming value socially   cinematically or otherwise    comedically it has some potential   but only in its stand up comedy moments   which i can turn on comedy central for    master p stars as fifty dollah    beat that !   as a mobster   i think   who is trying to start a comedy club/act with his little brother foolish   eddie griffin      but the two of them have to deal with an angry mob boss   played by andrew dice clay   for the very first time entertaining     a stubborn club owner and family problems   the latter in foolish is a perfect example of roger ebert s   idiot plot     if everyone here wasn t an idiot   there would be no problem    so what does foolish have to offer beside a bunch of idiotic character names    not a hell of a lot    as i have mentioned   master p cannot act or write    he acts like the rapper that he is    the occasional despair that his script requires him to exhibit is excruciatingly forced   as are his warm and fuzzy scenes with his little bro    as for his script    well   i suppose he delivers what one would expect from a musical artist with no previous screenwriting experience    if you haven t yet figured it out   that is not saying much    co star eddie griffin   really the star of the show   is quite a different story    the fact of the matter is that griffin   whose most significant screen outing to date is probably the mildly successful tv show malcolm and eddie on the fledgling upn network   is an extremely talented comedian   stand up and otherwise    he has much in common with chris tucker   rush hour   money talks   in how quickly and effortlessly his speech flows from his lips    he spouts profanity with impressive dexterity   to the extent which that can be done     and while i hope that does not become his trademark it works in a few scenes in this movie    and indeed   i laughed at a few stand up scenes here   but from a feature length movie i expect more    foolish provided me with no reason to care for these characters    every scene which has any potential for dramatic impact is effectively diffused by either a stupid joke   in a scene where tension escalates between the two brothers   foolish blurts out towards his jewelry sporting sibling   you lay one hand on me and this cemetary is going to be a gold rush     or something even more idiotic such as foolish smashing his own car   to which i said   a bit too loudly for the occasion   huh       after getting slightly upset with his wife    believe me when i say that there is nothing in foolish that warrants parting with your hard earned $8    you ll get more laughs from watching 30 minutes of comedy central or any virtually any sitcom if you don t have cable    eddie griffin fans may enjoy this derivative   although offensive   yarn   but everyone else should stay the hell away    &#137    

Neg, there re so many things to criticize about i don t know where to start    recommendation   turn off your brain   don t be like me   decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much    a comet is about to strike earth   causing a catastrophe similar to the extinction level event   e   l   e     that wiped out the dinosaurs    what follows is the story of a president s bid to think for the good of his people   a rising reporter   the love story of two teenagers   one of whom discovered the comet     and a team of astronauts on the ship `messiah  to save the world    firstly   there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film   nor is there anything outstandingly good about it     but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid    to be honest   i was more moved by the trailer than the film itself   which isn t saying much      mimi leder s follow up to `the peacemaker  is equally incompetent   with all the big stars wasted       perhaps i m just annoyed that the release of `the peacemaker  in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller   `the assignment       it is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision   but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives    however   the film simply fails on that note    the effects are worn out   the substandard screenplay limited the acting   and the director continued her sad run in terms of good film making credentials    she s still making good money though    t   a leoni s unfortunate character   the news reporter   is the foundation of the story and of the cast    but the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored    robert duvall s aging astronaut is lifeless   and morgan freeman s president is restricted to   well   a righteous president   which means he s not interesting at all      leoni s character is the only appealing one   and is played with reasonable conviction   but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc     but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters    warning   spoilers included   but a lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway      plot holes   plot holes   plot holes    now   e   l   e    is threatening to exterminate more than 99% of the human race   and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there    where s the logic    leder could have at least made it plausible with 20    and then it turns out that only a few percent of the world population actually perish   and those less selfish ones   the ones that stayed at home   were the victims    the film was almost mocking them   telling them they had died for nothing    i also fail to see how two teenagers   carrying a baby   would be the first to climb up the mountain/hill   even with a motorbike for a head start    it s unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle   but that doesn t really matter    building caves was a strategy mentioned in `dr    strangelove    which proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years    now that is a more practical use for caves    what is the point of living in caves    there is no   unlike `dr    strangelove    any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure    how do plants grow    if humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves   there s no reason why they can t do it in the open    the president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves    obviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago   and you can t be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media    in an important mission like that of the `messiah    for that matter any mission   it is impossible that isn t sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres   needless to say tens of kilometres    this is not deep impact   it s a frivolous cheap impact    but even with all that   some overacting   and a 3   4 rating   it s still watchable   just don t think about it    okay    

Neg, teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood    every year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular   and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights   wallets in hand    the formula is very simple   you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal    you add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds   and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 90 minutes   the typical teenage attention span    the response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any = film set in an environment they can relate to   and   most importantly   they don92t care to judge films=92 quality   so any piece of trash will = due    that is just what never been kissed   the latest film from director raja gosnell   is   trash    josie geller   drew barrymore   is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times    she has her own personal assistant   unlimited supplies   and her own office    but she is very much dismayed with her position in life    there is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter and go out into the field   where she can play a more active role in the chicago media    so when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere   she jumps at it with elation    constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita   molly shannon   and her amicable superior   gus   john c   reilly      the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment   as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter    however   since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict   this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes   and josie is headed for the field    obviously   the field assignment involves a high school    specifically   she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school   by enrolling in the senior class and   becoming one of them      i don92t think that i = need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring   so i won92t    the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school    interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was   and she appears to be heading down that road again    fortunately for this lame production   other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting    they include the predictable love stories   between both a student   jeremy jordan   and a teacher   michael vartan     to show that josie is really two people in one body    also   her younger brother and opposite   rob   david arquette   comes into her new found life and even causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative    the humor found in this film is actually quite amusing    typical for teenage films   it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor    one scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical    most of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy    but those still don92t = recover for the total lack of quality in this movie    following this trend of high school movie rules   comes the general acting    it is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film    in this case   drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch    she is required to play her character on two levels   having some very black and white transitions    and although some scenes are written to be particular shades of gray   she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time    at one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel   and is expected to him on an adult level   since he is one   her teacher    but she never seems to get out of the gray area   and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good performance    following barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon   saturday night live      she seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to   and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic    it is these   qualities   that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent    luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film    david arquette   scream   takes home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic   and not have his brilliant acting ruined    and as a central character he gets to take on his own mini plot   which is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed    in a dazzling cherry on the sundae type piece of work   he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the 1983 hit   risky business    never been kissed is a mediocre film at best    the predictable plot has become so overplayed in hollywood   that it is sickening to watch time and again   and this film is no exception    the acting is just as bad   but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light    unfortunately   the bottom line is that the movie will be a success   because teenagers will pay to see any trash    

Neg, walken stars as a mobster who is kidnapped and held for ransom by four bratty rich kids    it seems that a woman has also been kidnapped  she is the sister of one of them   e   t    s  henry thomas   and the girlfriend of another   flannery     and the asking price is $2 million   which said snots are unable to cough up alone    they even cut off walken s finger to show they mean business   because they are desperate to save the woman s life    suicide kings is a terrible film    walken aside   there isn t a single appealing cast member    o fallon creates characters that are functional types without any resonance    in an amusingly unironic scene   walken plays poker with the foursome and describes each of their personalities to a tee  it s as if he was reading the summary sheet for a casting director    the plot is another issue entirely    o fallon is someone whom i m betting has seen reservoir dogs and the usual suspects too many times   for not only does his story veer off on bizarre tangents from whence they never return   do we really need the scene where dennis leary beats up an abusive father with a toaster   which is entirely unrelated to both the story and leary s character   or the numerous anecdotal sequences       but the central plot itself is a serpentine mess   filled with crosses and double crosses and triple crosses        by the fourth big revelation/twist   i had completely tuned out   wondering what on earth attracted these actors to the material    recently a peer   a fellow young filmmaker   informed me that he had an idea for a movie about four guys   the mob   and the fbi    it occurred to me then what s wrong with indies like suicide kings   i suspect o fallon has never met a mobster   is not a rich man   doesn t deliver endless   clever   monologues to his friends about his favourite types of boots        in short   these guys are just riffing on other movies   and in doing that   making the same film over and over and over again    tarantino found his niche and now hundreds of genxers with movie cameras are trying to find tarantino s niche instead of carving their own     reviewed at the toronto international film festival  

Neg, >from writer and director darren stein comes jawbreaker   the poorly told tale of what can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong    at reagan high   four girls are sitting on top of the world    courtney shane   played by rose mcgowan   holds the title of meanest   most disrespectful soul in the school    everyone hates her   but everyone envies her due to her popularity    courtney is the   leader   of her clique   which also includes julie   played by rebecca gayheart   liz purr   played by charlotte roldan   and marcie   played by julie benz are the other three in the group    it is liz s seventeenth birthday   and julie   courtney   and marcie concur that they will play a seemingly innocent prank on her   but the prank results in the death of liz    just like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as this one   the foursome decide to cover up the death to make it look like a murder committed by someone else    and also just like in other teen directed movies   one of the four don t agree with hiding it   this time that character being julie    and finally   just like in other teen movies   there is a witness outside the group trying to hide the truth    this time that character being fern mayo   judy greer     who is subject to many cracks from courtney s group   as well as the entire school    >from here   jawbreaker turns into a predictable tale of revenge   bad morals   and at least trying to do the right thing    not only is the script weak   on a whole the acting is horrid thanks to a large amount of the main cast    judy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional   annoying character   as she overacts every line she has    also on the bad side of acting is julie benz   almost falling to the annoying factor that greer delivers    on the positive side of acting   rose mcgowan performs well here   but doesn t match her wickedly clever performance as   tatum     in 1996 s scream    mcgowan s role is annoying   but this only adds to the film    she is wickedly mean   and even though she a well written character   you downright hate her    faring even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart   who is always exceptionally believable as her roles    when the script feeds her a one or two dimensional character   she turns it into three   always putting strong emotion and power into her roles    gayheart isn t given as much to do here as she was in 1998 s urban legend   but you can still get a strong taste of her acting skills in jawbreaker    jawbreaker drifts and mianders different sub plots throughout   hardly throwing anything for the viewer to get absorbed in    we get way off of the topic of the jawbreaker incident   and get into things that don t have anything to do with the actual film    the beginning and ending are strong   it s just the middle that needs a lot of help    during the body of the movie   it is undeniably repetitive   never progressing towards a conclusion    nothing to grab the viewer s interest is around   and the same   extremely annoying song plays over and over again    jawbreaker tries to get off on the same time of humor used in the 1995 film clueless   but falls flat    the few gags that actually work die off quickly and die off with a bang    all in all   a horrible disappointment    the bottom line   the tagline reads     even the sweetest candies are sour as death inside      yes   that is too true    no matter how good this film may have looked   it fails to deliver    

Neg, birthdays often cause individuals to access their lives    are we doing what we want to be doing    what happened to our dreams    with the new millennium   our collective big birthday   just around the corner   some people are sensing a certain dissatisfaction with their existence    the old standbys of traditional religion and science aren t doing it for many anymore and they re looking for something else    we ll be seeing more and more films with a metaphysical theme over the next few years    ricky hayman   jeff goldblum   is having a career crisis    the programming director for the good buy home shopping network   he s going to be fired unless sales increase dramatically    new producer kate newell   kelly preston   is supposed to whip things into shape    when the two are fixing a flat   they almost run down new age pilgrim   g     murphy      g wanders onto the television set and connects with the viewers by telling them that they don t really want all that commercial crap    in some unexplained manner   this causes sales to sour    ricky is saved    the movie tries to be too much at once and fails at it all    it s not an over the top comedy or a heart warming message of humanity    it  is  a mish mosh of poorly directed scenes made even worse by insipid dialog    i am willing to put up with preaching from a film   but the messages here are old hat    you should take time to smell the roses    selling your soul for cash is a bad idea    golly    i m glad i saw the movie    i never would have thought of these    the opportunity to poke fun at the goofy products is mostly missed    when g takes a chainsaw to the set   there s an obvious chance for murphy to be hilarious    it doesn t happen    the bits are so subdued and overly long that there s only a hint of laughter from the audience    murphy has changed his roles in recent years and not for the better    there are hints of promise in this one    the only time the film picks up even a little is when his shaved headed character in the long flowing white caftan shows up on screen    the others are horrendous    goldblum has episodes of brilliance in his career   but here he seems to have been replaced with a lifeless pod from his   invasion of the body snatchers      his relationship with kate makes no sense    they move from antagonism to love somewhere off screen    preston is as uninteresting as she could possibly be    somewhere hidden deep inside of this film is about ten minutes of value    an attempt to satirize stupid television   we get a self parody instead    

Neg, synopsis   a maniac   crazed by virulent microphage   slaughters more than twenty people   including a street gang and heavily armed troops   with a small knife    even with a handgun   however   he can t take out the two cops who are after him   despite having shot one of them a total of seven times    comments   the most notable aspect of adrenalin   fear the rush is that it marks a striking career move for natasha henstridge    not only does she manage to keep all her clothes on   her trademark in earlier films such as species and maximum risk was to strip naked as often as possible     but she actually puts on even more clothes as the film progresses    this will probably disappoint many henstridge fans   but i welcome the change because henstridge is an attractive   capable actress who deserves less exploitative roles   though   i admit   it doesn t show in this mess      henstridge   just like every other actor in the film   delivers a wooden performance in this monumental turkey       the cast also includes christopher lambert   who has appeared in the highlander and mortal kombat films      how on earth this movie got two big name stars to appear in it is beyond me    adrenalin   fear the rush is set in boston ten years in the future   2007      boston has changed dramatically in those ten years    it is now home to a bunch of interred foreigners and policed by cops who drive around in small cars with   policia   printed on their doors    some guy has a really bad virus   and he s killing people because of it    so   the brave good guys   lambert and henstridge   go after him    that s it    76 minutes never seemed so long    this is a drawn out chase scene through dimly lit abandoned buildings turned into an entire movie    the plot development is nil   we learn absolutely nothing about lambert s character and very little about henstridge s character    the dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark corridor/tunnel/airduct next and who will carry the flashlight    a subplot does exist involving henstridge s character s illegal attempt to get her son out of boston    in her opening monologue   a monologue which sounds as though henstridge was reading from cue cards   we learn that she has gone to great lengths to secure a fake passport for her son    twenty minutes into the film   i wondered if the movie would have been better if it focused on this plot    in a defining scene of the movie   however   i changed my mind    this fake passport drops to the ground    lambert s cop immediately recognizes it as a fraud from six feet away    must not have been a good fake    this emphasizes another fault with the film    things just defy common sense    lambert s cop   for instance   is shot seven times   yet he is still able to talk and slide about    adrenalin   fear the rush ends in a trite manner that doesn t seem to even fit the mood that the filmmakers were trying for    i found myself rather bored with this film   which will disappoint both sci fi/horror fans and fans of henstridge and lambert    don t fear the rush    fear the movie    watch something else    

Neg, and just when you thought joblo was getting a little soft around the corners   not rating anything lower than your standard   this movie sucks     along comes this cinematic atrocity and he s forced to take out his secret weapon and spray it with a stench so thick   even the bravest movie goer would think twice about seeing this waste of time    yes   despite being a third sequel to a successful original movie   the latest highlander doesn t seem to have anything going for it    oh stinky movie   let me count thee ways        plot     from what i understood   a really bad highlander dude comes to the present looking to whack out the nice highlander dudes in order to gain their power and become the mightiest immortal       or  something along those lines    critique   a complete and utter mess    disjointed   incoherent   boring   corny   filled with bad dialogue       and  that s just the first thirty minutes !  this film doesn t seem to know what to do with itself    it s confusing to anyone who doesn t know the series   i include myself in that group   and apparently idiotic to those who do know the series   i include die hard highlander fan the arrow in that group      the film doesn t explain anything about itself       it  just goes from one inexplicable situation to another    one moment they re in the present time   the next moment   they re in italy in the 1600s    why    who knows    what are they talking about    no idea    flashbacks mixed in with the present   mixed in with a few spontaneously cheesy fight sequences every now and again   and i even remember seeing one flashback scene which went even further into its own flashback scene ! !  hullo         !    confused yet    i was and i basically stopped giving a crap about anyone in the film when i realized that neither the writer or director was interested in presenting me with any kind of semblance of a story    random swordplay   mad max like dudes showing up in motorcycles in the 1800s    or were they in the present at that time    who knows       and to be honest       who  seriously cares !  this series should have been shot in the head and put out of its own misery a long time ago   but sadly   someone at the studio decided that it still had a little life left in it    please   please       for the love of god and all that is holy in the world of movie making   and mostly out of respect for those who loved the original film   put this series to bed and end it !  even christopher lambert knew enough to play second fiddle to adrian paul in this one    the director also tries to do the best he can with the muddled material   but all he could come up with is plenty of slo mo action   some fast motion fight scenes and lots of smoke everywhere    and is there anything spectacular about the sword play or fight scenes    nope    and i think we all could have done without all those zooming lambert face close ups       yipes    the man is not aging gracefully   is he    oh boy   and i haven t even gotten around to the greatest piece of over acting that i ve seen in years    the man who plays kell in this movie   bruce payne   should get a ham trophy for literally chewing up every piece of scenery that he gets near    overacting is not a hobby for this guy       it s  a living !  he s also very funny   not purposely though    all in all   the movie stinks    nuff said    

Neg, warren beatty   diane keaton   goldie hawn and gary shandling star as a pair of married couples whose complacent lives are about to be shaken up in director peter chelsom s version of the classic romantic   screwball comedy in   town & country      the drawing room farce of the 30 s dealt with sexual innuendo and relied on wit and a great deal of commotion and noise to place the viewer in the thick of the duplicitous romantic action    back then   impossibly wealthy scions of society   with too much free time   would get themselves wrapped up in all sorts of sexual peccadilloes with spouses and lovers   only to have everything come out all right in the end   see   the philadelphia story   for a great farce       town & country   has the impossibly wealthy protagonists with too much free time   the kind of people that have jobs but never seem to work   and sexual misconduct on several levels    but   there is almost no life to original script by michael laughlin and buck henry and this is   t&c s   downfall    there is   obviously   a great deal of hollywood talent   in front of and behind the camera   involved in   town & country     but   without a likable or   at least   interesting story to carry through their efforts   it is all for naught    and   that s what we get here   naught    porter stoddard   beatty   is a high powered new york architect with a very good life indeed    his 25 year marriage to ellie   diane keaton   appears   on the surface   to be perfect    but   there are cracks just below this pristine surface    his wife is suspicious of his whereabouts   his kids don t need him and his best friends   griffin   garry shandling   and mona   goldie hawn     are in the midst of a divorce    porter tries to get control of his life before it is too late   but like a man fighting against quicksand   his struggle just sinks him deeper    at the 90 minute mark of   town & country   i asked myself     what s the point      i wasn t entertained   i laughed three times   over silly little pratfalls   and spent most of the film marking time  til the end    warren beatty wanders around with his character in a bewildered fog   making problems for himself by thinking with a part of his anatomy other than his head    keaton s ellie is an empty headed flake who can t see the obvious as porter screws around on her    and   as you get to know them   who would want friends like griffin and mona    the supporting cast is given nothing to do and   sometimes   does harm to the film   given the material they are forced to use    nastassja kinski plays a cellist with whom porter has a fling    the actress   who has   eerily   failed to age over the years   is miscast as the air headed musician and the character doesn t belong   anyway    jenna elfman is a sweet   but smart   ditz who joins porter and griffin on one of their tacked on misadventures    andie macdowell is absolutely painful to watch as a wealthy heiress   is there any other kind in this movie      who comes on to porter    the saving grace is a pair of quirky perf s by charlton heston and marian seldes as macdowell s very strange parents    glib rationalization of infidelity   like     if he doesn t speak english   it doesn t count     are a staple for the screenplay    the morality of the film seems to be   if you can get away with it   go for it    the cast of characters are mostly people you wouldn t want to know   never mind befriend    the actors do their best   but are hamstrung by the weak material    helmer chelsom   who made the outstanding   offbeat comedy   funny bones     is mired in the mess of a script and never puts his imprint on   town & country      the production values are high   as one expects from a big budget hollywood film    but   the opulent sets by caroline hanania   lavish wardrobes by molly maginnis and top notch photography by william fraker cannot save   town & country      the film has had a long list of production and distribution problems and it might have been better   for me anyway   if hollywood just said no to this movie    i give it a d    

Neg, with his successful books and movies   michael crichton is doing well    with early successes with westworld   1973   and coma   1978     and recent films such as jurassic park   1993     his films have been entertaining    however   he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere    this $100 million mess by good director barry levison   disclosure   is dull   long winded   and a huge disappointment    considering the huge budget   the all star cast   and a story by crichton   sphere is majorly disappointing    the film opens with norman goodman   hoffman     a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors    however   when he arrives   he his told by supervisor barnes   peter coyote   that he is actually investigating an spacecraft    along with goodman is mathematician harry adams   jackson     biologist beth halperin   stone   and ted fielding   liev schrieber      they investigate the spaceship   find a massive sphere inside   meet an alien intelligence called jerry   and basically weird crap happens    unfortunately   something went wrong along the way with sphere    the film starts off entertaining enough   but throughout this very long movie   it just gets sillier and sillier    the film jaunts along from scene to scene   never fully explaining what is going on    the actors and directing don t help   either    hoffman is on autopilot   and almost seems embarrassed   throughout the movie   churning out dull lines   and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie    stone is useless   displaying no emotion   and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman    the only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson   who s funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere    but he s hardly in it   and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone    the same goes for peter coyote   who hams it up as the officer   but is then killed off halfway through    the director   barry levinson   who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure   1994   messes up with the drama and the action    the drama scenes are   quite frankly   boring   and the action scenes suffer from overkill   with levison throwing the camera all over the place   much like the godawful speed 2   1997    the writing doesn t help much   either    although crichton is great with plots   he s terrible with dialogue   and practically every line in sphere is a dud    the speech is too simple   i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent    practically every line is just stating the obvious    none of it is smart    also   where the hell did the budget go    the sphere itself is impressive   and there s a few nice special effect shots   but where the $100 million went is anyone s guess    there s a giant squid attack in the picture   but not once does the audience see the squid   even though the film has a massive budget    i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid   and if handled correctly it probably would    but the whole scene is done badly   and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid    finally   the film has no idea what genre to be    levison can t handle his own plot    it leaps from hokey sci fi   to horror   and finally the shining/event horizon psychological thriller    and   of course   the film is very much like the abyss   1988     although in it s defense   crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released   and is far superior to this rubbish      it s not all that bad though    the plot is all right   there s a few jump scenes   although nothing very scary   and there s the occasionally interesting bit    but overall   sphere is a big waste of some fine talent   a lot of money   and a potentially good movie    not really worth seeing    overall rating= review by david wilcock  

Neg, movies like six days   seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford   anne heche   and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cents      the script was written by michael browning   and he decided that   instead of thinking up new ideas   he d rehash a lot of cliches   omit even the slightest bit of character development   and then throw in drug dealing pirates to provide for a few high level action sequences and explosions      there are good scripts out there that high profile actors can make   see the truman show   for instance        six days   seven nights is simply a waste    let s see            we have to get harrison ford and anne heche alone on an island      so   how do we do that      well   we ll make her a feisty magazine editor   and we ll make him a crusty old pilot      but wait   she has to have a fianc   e   that can be david schwimmer      but wait   if she has a fianc   e   how will she and harrison ford crash on the island alone      i know !    they ll get to their vacation spot   and then she ll get called back !    yessssss !    so   they ll crash on the island   and that will be funny for about five minutes      shucks    oh   i ve got it !    we ll throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc   e has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo   and then he can feel guilty      then   when anne heche kisses harrison ford   they have to kiss   because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie     it will be a vindicated action   because her fianc   e will already have cheated on her !    then   for no obvious reason   they ll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them      oh   yes !    i feel so good about this story      instead of using characterization to propel the events   it will be completely random   and yet totally predictable !    imagine that    don t get me wrong    six days   seven nights is not a boring picture   ford and heche both do a great job      the sparks fly between them   and so most of browning s inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors  sheer force of talent       almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen   and i found myself laughing pretty hard      schwimmer is also funny   and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get      and reitman   who has made some good films   at least tries to make things exciting      even though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb   i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences    it s just when i start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces      the picture feels like it s been hacked to pieces    i wouldn t be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely      the ones that are here are as bad as they come   i think i let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships     and i d just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream     why did you pick this awful script !        the film is outright stupid   but some of the elements are subtly horrifying      for instance   take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo   and then feels really guilty      this is a serious problem in real life   but six days   seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device     his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford      in a script that lacks even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety   i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story    this is summer movie season   but that doesn t mean our movies have to be dumb      1998 so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters      when i was in line for six days   seven nights   i heard the woman in front of me ask for   two tickets to that new harrison ford movie         why didn t she know the name of the film      i suppose she just didn t care       what bothers me even more is that the people who make these big budget pictures don t realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves      good actors should sign to good scripts   and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash   they least they could do is assume that we d like to spend our money on a story worth more than ten cents    

Neg, there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director    of course   his best film was 1978 s masterpiece     halloween     but he also made 1980 s   the fog     and 1987 s underrated     prince of darkness      heck   he even made a good film in 1995   with   in the mouth of madness      but something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992   with the terrible comedy     memoirs of an invisible man      somehow   carpenter has lost his touch   with junk like his failed 1995 remake of     village of the damned     to his uninspired 1996 sequel     escape from l   a     those movies   however   look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film     john carpenter s vampires      if i was him   i definately wouldn t want to put my own name in the title    it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as     vampires      the story is simple    jack crow   james woods   is a vampire hunter who   along with one of his partners   montoya   daniel baldwin     and a prostitute   katrina   sheryl lee     survives an attack from the master vampire   valek   thomas ian griffith      since katrina was previously bitten by him   crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later   and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her    it seems valek s mission is to steal a black   wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him    my question is   how many time have we seen this same story played out    well   the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made       john carpenter s vampires     sadly enough   is one of the most unscary horror films i ve ever seen    in fact   there isn t even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105 minute running time    the non stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed   without any interesting camera work   which is usually a trademark of carpenter s    and then we come to the screenplay   which   as far as i can tell   is nearly non existent    there is no story development   and there isn t even an attempt to flesh out the characters    james woods can be a good actor   but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of   pseudo    clever lines of dialogue    daniel baldwin has some potential   but his character comes off as being very dense    and sheryl lee   faring much better as laura palmer in   twin peaks       like all of the female characters   plays an offensive stereotypical whore    there is not an ounce of intelligence   or excitement in     john carpenter s vamires     which is very disheartening coming from an ex fan of carpenter s    he has said that he turned down directing     halloween   h20     because he couldn t work up any excitement for it    and yet   when asked about a   vampires   sequel   he said he would be happy to do it    i think that s a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent   not to mention a significant number of iq points
